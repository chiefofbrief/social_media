## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview

**Indicators:**
- **Gold** hovering ~$5,100 — strong but stalling as robust employment data reduces the Fed's case for rate cuts (WSJ #25). The sustained gold level reflects continued safe-haven demand even as equities sit near records.
- **Treasury Yields** rising on back of the jobs report — U.S. added 130K-180K jobs (WSJ #1, r/stocks #11). The headline beat masked a concurrent benchmark revision that wiped out prior gains (r/stocks #11 flags this as a "smokescreen"). Strong labor data further diminishes near-term rate cut probability.
- **Oil** up ~2% on U.S.-Iran tensions (WSJ #27). Crude stockpiles posted a large +8.5M barrel weekly build against expectations of a -400K draw (WSJ #26) — a sharp divergence suggesting demand softness even as geopolitical risk supports price.
- **Dollar** falling — WSJ Dollar Index down for 3 consecutive days (WSJ #28, #29), consistent with the broader weakening trend noted in the global rotation thesis (see SESSION_NOTES: Global Markets).
- **U.S. National Debt** crossed $38 trillion (r/stocks #1). The pace of debt growth acceleration is the more relevant signal — $5.7T (2000) → $38T (2026).
- **Population slowdown** projected to deliver a $100B hit to the U.S. economy (Barron's #27), complemented by France's birth-rate concerns (Barron's #26). Long-term structural headwind for growth forecasts.

**Sentiment:** Mixed but leaning cautious. Dow eyeing a 4th straight record (WSJ #1, #22), SPY flat at $692.62 — headline indices masking turbulence underneath. Software sector in crisis mode (see below), crypto-adjacent names bleeding, and several high-profile earnings misses (MAT, U, LYFT). Alphabet issuing 100-year bonds (WSJ #3) signals easy money conditions — but Michael Burry's comparison to Motorola's similar 1997 move (r/stocks #5) is a cautionary flag. The Dow's record march amid undercurrents of labor data manipulation concerns and sector rotation suggests a market running on momentum rather than broad conviction. Per **Part III** of the Guidelines: when the market is overly optimistic on headline indices, be more selective and raise the bar.

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning (Sector-Specific)

**Compute & Chips (Layer 1-2):**
- **TSMC** January revenue +37% YoY on AI chip demand (r/stocks #6). The structural demand case remains intact at the foundry level.
- **Micron (MU)** +8.17%, the standout mover today. CFO expressed confidence in HBM product, and competition fears are easing (Barron's #24). At $403.74, the memory thesis from SESSION_NOTES (AI demand crowding out supply, Q1 prices +80-90%) continues to play out. However, per the AI framework's **Memory Constraints** thesis: monitor whether this is structural demand or a cyclical peak.
- **Cisco Silicon One G300** — a new networking chip challenging NVIDIA's closed ecosystem (r/options #14). This is relevant to the AI framework's "customer defection risk" for NVIDIA. Cisco is attacking the interconnect layer with an open Ethernet alternative. Worth monitoring but early-stage.
- **SOXL** +6.29% (Most Active) — semiconductor bull leveraged ETF surging, consistent with the compute layer strength.

**Infrastructure & Power (Layer 3):**
- **Vertiv (VRT)** earnings beat: Q4 EPS $1.36 vs. $1.29 expected, revenue in-line at $2.9B (Barron's #30). Stock soaring, "shaking off concerns the AI trade is losing steam." This is the infrastructure execution year thesis playing out — but per the **Glamour Metrics Trap** (Part II): need to verify whether the beat is driven by genuine operating cash flow improvement or just top-line momentum.

**Models & Tools (Layer 4-7):**
- **Google/Wiz** $32B acquisition approved unconditionally by EU (r/stocks #4). Strengthens Google's cloud security positioning. Relevant to the orchestration/data services layer where switching costs are higher.

**Applications & Software (Layer 8) — THE DOMINANT THEME TODAY:**
- **Unity Software (U)** -28% on weak guidance despite earnings beat (Barron's #28/29). This is the "AI fears" narrative hitting gaming/dev tools. The weak outlook "intensifies AI worries" — but the question per the Guidelines is whether this is narrative or reality.
- **Dassault Systèmes** -20% on just 1% growth (r/stocks #8). Legacy enterprise software getting punished hard. "Is AI quietly eating legacy software?" is the headline — this is the **Software Disruption vs. Moat Durability** tension from the AI framework playing out in real-time.
- **Cloudflare** surging on earnings beat and positive outlook — positioned to win from a "Dead Internet" where AI drives increasing traffic (Barron's #37). Counter-narrative to the software doom.
- **Shopify** -10% on earnings miss but rising on revenue beat + $2B buyback program (Barron's #40). Market rewarding revenue + capital return even when earnings disappoint.
- **Software Short Squeeze** potential flagged by Barron's (#2): heavy short interest + stabilizing prices could spark a near-term rally. Wall Street's top brass (Goldman, Blackstone) trying to soothe software jitters, calling last week's slide "overblown" (WSJ #2). JP Morgan's "AI-Resilient" software list gaining attention again (r/stocks #3). Reddit discussions show retail actively looking at beaten-down software names (r/ValueInvesting #6, #11, r/stocks #14).
- **AI threatening wealth management** — St. James's Place leads European wealth manager tumble (WSJ #19, #20). The AI disruption narrative is now extending beyond software into financial services.
- **AI in Medicare** — Trump administration using AI to cut Medicare costs (Barron's #7). Directly relevant to the UNH thesis in SESSION_NOTES (margin compression + now AI-driven cost scrutiny on top).

---

### 3. Applied Investment Flags (General)

**Narrative vs. Reality:**
- **Jobs Report Dissonance**: The headline "130K-180K jobs" beat is being celebrated (Dow record, WSJ #1), but r/stocks #11 details a "benchmark revision wipeout" that erases prior gains. White House is pre-emptively blaming weakness on AI, deportations, and government cuts (International Intrigue). This is classic post-hoc rationalization territory. The *real* signal may be in the divergence: healthcare propping up job creation (WSJ #17) while other sectors quietly soften.
- **Software "Crisis" vs. Opportunity**: The software sector is in maximum fear mode — massive short positions, AI disruption narrative, multiple -15% to -28% single-day drops. But the *same* Wall Street firms that are short are now publicly saying the selloff is "overblown" (WSJ #2). This is textbook **Opportunity Source** per Part I: out-of-favor situations driven by fear, with potential for temporary vs. permanent mispricings.
- **Amazon's "Worst Run Since 2022"** (Barron's #4): AMZN at $204.04, losing $400B+ in market cap over 7 sessions. The narrative is bearish, but per SESSION_NOTES we already own AMZN at $222.71 with a thesis around the CapEx pivot and strong OCF. The current price represents a deeper discount from our entry — the question is whether this is narrative-driven (general AI capex fear) or fundamental deterioration. Given Q4 results already confirmed the thesis, this appears to be sentiment contagion rather than new information.
- **Alphabet's 100-Year Bond**: Burry comparing it to Motorola 1997 (r/stocks #5) is provocative but the analogy is weak — Google's cash generation profile is categorically different from late-90s Motorola. The more relevant read is WSJ #3: "This is a great time for companies to borrow. It isn't obviously a great time to lend to them." This signals **easy money conditions** that enable reflexive dynamics per Part III.

**Edge Opportunities:**
- **CVNA Accounting Red Flags**: A judge ordered Carvana to release files on off-the-books transactions with closely held partner "DriveTime" (r/options #6). Shares fell $40 as of midday. This maps directly to the **Financial Statement Red Flags** framework (Part II): "When one manipulation is found, assume others exist." The off-the-books relationship with an affiliated entity is classic related-party risk. Multiple r/options users comparing this to Enron.
- **EU Visa/Mastercard Alternatives** (r/stocks #7): EPI pushing for alternatives to U.S. payment rails. Interesting counter-read for PYPL — Europe's push for payment independence could either threaten or benefit PayPal depending on whether PayPal positions as a neutral alternative or gets swept up as a U.S. incumbent.
- **Mattel -22% vs. Hasbro Soaring** (Barron's #49, #44): Massive divergence between two direct competitors. Mattel missed on earnings + guidance while Hasbro hit 6-year highs. The tariff narrative (Barron's #44: "a problem for the Fed") is applying broadly, but the stock-level divergence suggests company-specific execution issues at Mattel rather than pure macro.

---

### 4. Screening Candidates

**Candidate 1: CVNA (Carvana) — Accounting Red Flags**
- **Ticker/Theme:** CVNA
- **The Signal:** r/options #6, #7, #8 — Judge orders release of off-the-books transaction files between Carvana and DriveTime.
- **What News Says:** Shares fell ~$40 intraday after the court order. Multiple options traders positioned short via puts and ratio spreads. One poster calls it "the Enron of the automotive space."
- **The Why:** Off-the-books transactions with a closely held affiliate is a textbook related-party manipulation risk. Per the Guidelines: "When one manipulation is found, assume others exist." CVNA was recently added to the S&P 500, which adds reflexive dynamics — index inclusion inflates the stock, which supports the business model (used car financing), which supports the stock.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Verify the nature of DriveTime transactions — are they circular revenue, inventory transfers at non-market prices, or financing arrangements that obscure leverage?
  - Check CVNA's OCF vs. reported earnings divergence over recent quarters
  - Review SEC filings for related-party disclosures and auditor notes
  - Assess short interest levels and options positioning for squeeze/crash asymmetry
- **Data Gap:** The actual content of the court-ordered files is unknown. Need the filings to determine whether this is a genuine accounting scandal or a governance nuisance.

---

**Candidate 2: Software Sector Short Squeeze**
- **Ticker/Theme:** Software Basket (ADBE, CRM, NOW, WDAY, SNOW, MSFT, CRWD, PANW, ZS)
- **The Signal:** Barron's #2 ("Software stocks headed for short squeeze"), WSJ #2 ("Wall Street soothing jitters"), r/stocks #3 (JP Morgan AI-Resilient list), r/ValueInvesting #6, #11, r/stocks #8, #14.
- **What News Says:** Heavy short interest + stabilizing prices = potential near-term rally. Goldman and Blackstone executives say the selloff was "overblown." Dassault Systèmes -20% on 1% growth is accelerating the panic. Reddit retail actively accumulating beaten-down names.
- **The Why:** Maximum bearish consensus creates the setup for a reflexive reversal. Per Part I (**Opportunity Sources**): mispricings concentrate in out-of-favor situations. The critical question is whether the AI disruption thesis is *temporary* pessimism (mispricing) or *permanent* impairment (justified). The JP Morgan list provides a useful filter for "moat durability" — names with deep enterprise integrations and high switching costs.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Compare FCF yields across the beaten-down software names to identify where margin of safety is greatest
  - Verify whether the selloff has brought any of these names to historical valuation floors (P/FCF, EV/Revenue)
  - Assess short interest as % of float for squeeze candidates vs. fundamentally-justified short positions
  - Cross-reference with the Emanuel "Battered Stocks" screen from SESSION_NOTES (CRM, ADBE, NOW, SailPoint, WDAY overlap)
- **Data Gap:** Need current FCF multiples and short interest data to separate value from speculation.

---

**Candidate 3: VRT (Vertiv) — AI Infrastructure Execution**
- **Ticker/Theme:** VRT
- **The Signal:** Barron's #30 — Q4 EPS beat ($1.36 vs. $1.29 expected), stock soaring, "shaking off AI trade concerns."
- **What News Says:** Vertiv's data center infrastructure business (power/cooling) delivered a strong quarter. The beat is being interpreted as proof the AI infrastructure buildout is real and on track.
- **The Why:** Vertiv sits at the **Infrastructure & Power** layer — the physical bottleneck layer where execution determines winners. A beat here validates the "Execution Year" thesis from the AI framework. However, per the **Glamour Metrics Trap**: need to verify this isn't just revenue momentum without cash flow follow-through.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Verify OCF trajectory — is the EPS beat translating to actual cash generation?
  - Check order backlog and pipeline for sustainability
  - Assess valuation relative to peers (ETN, JCI) — has the market already priced in the infrastructure thesis?
  - Review customer concentration — is Vertiv dependent on a few hyperscaler contracts?
- **Data Gap:** OCF and backlog data from the earnings release needed to distinguish substance from narrative.

---

**Candidate 4: PYPL (PayPal) — Continued Signal Convergence**
- **Ticker/Theme:** PYPL
- **The Signal:** r/ValueInvesting #2 ("very conservative DCF gives ~$91 fair value"), r/stocks #2 (CEO $62.5M pay package tied to stock price targets).
- **What News Says:** Reddit DCF analysis using conservative inputs (55% growth over 10 years, 13% margins) yields ~$91 fair value vs. current ~$40. Separately, the new CEO compensation is structured with aggressive stock price milestones ($100, $125 targets). Multiple posters in 158-comment thread debating the bull/bear case.
- **The Why:** Continued convergence of signals on a stock we already have under deep analysis. The CEO compensation structure is interesting — management incentives are now strongly aligned with shareholder returns via stock appreciation (not just operational metrics). Per SESSION_NOTES, our own analysis confirms structural profitability (7.5x earnings, 15% FCF yield, 23% ROIC). The EU push for Visa/Mastercard alternatives (r/stocks #7) could provide a tailwind if PayPal positions as a non-card alternative infrastructure.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Review the full CEO compensation package (SEC filing referenced in r/stocks #2) for vesting conditions and timeline
  - Assess whether the $60.5M max payout creates perverse short-term incentives (financial engineering to hit price targets vs. genuine value creation)
  - EU payment independence push — does PayPal's network position it as beneficiary or bystander?
- **Data Gap:** Full compensation package terms. Decision on PYPL position still pending per SESSION_NOTES.

---

**Candidate 5: MAT (Mattel) — Earnings Collapse vs. Hasbro Divergence**
- **Ticker/Theme:** MAT
- **The Signal:** Barron's #49 (-30% plunge), Barron's #44 (tariff warning for Fed), Most Active list (-22.01%).
- **What News Says:** Mattel's earnings and guidance "disappointed investors" while rival Hasbro closed at a 6-year high. Barron's #44 frames it as a market-wide tariff warning. Price dropped to $16.43.
- **The Why:** Extreme single-day move in a brand-name consumer company creates potential **Opportunity Source** (Part I). The divergence with Hasbro is key — if tariffs were the primary driver, both should be hit. Hasbro soaring while Mattel crashes suggests company-specific execution failure. Per Part II (**Brand Name Dynamics**): brand-name stocks recover faster when quality remains intact — the question is whether Mattel's quality is intact.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Compare Mattel vs. Hasbro guidance in detail — what specifically drove the divergence?
  - Assess tariff exposure: manufacturing footprint, input costs, pricing power
  - Review Mattel's recent product pipeline and IP portfolio (Barbie, Hot Wheels) for durability
  - Check balance sheet — does Mattel have the financial resilience to weather a bad year?
- **Data Gap:** Full earnings report details and tariff impact quantification needed to distinguish temporary problem from structural decline.

# 🌍 On the edge of three wars

Plus: Secret Sahara meetings

Feb 11, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— On the edge of three wars  
— Secret Sahara meetings  
— Playing dirty in Hungary

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. Some of our OG subscribers might remember when Intrigue was a weekly newsletter which focused on two big stories of the week (now we’ve got our hands full covering more than our fair share of global stories on the daily).

One of these early Intrigue editions covered the conflict between Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front. The delicate peace that’s managed to hold since then now looks wobbly, pushing the country back into the spotlight.

Our top story today looks at the key issues driving insecurity in **Ethiopia and the region** , including intriguing reports that it’s hosting a secret camp to train Sudanese paramilitaries.

### Resignation of the day

**Mrinank Sharma**

That’s Anthropic’s head of AI safety, who just quit to go write poetry in the UK, [warning](<https://x.com/MrinankSharma/status/2020881722003583421>) “ _the world is in peril_ ”. Seems like a fun guy, though the next day, Anthropic’s latest risk report [noted](<https://x.com/AnthropicAI/status/2021397952791707696>) an AI model had supported “ _chemical weapon development and other heinous crimes_ ”.

### **Red Sea axis**

Think you’re busy? Wait ‘til you meet Ethiopia’s **Abiy Ahmed Ali** (above), who’s now juggling three separate and interrelated conflicts, starting with… 

  1. **Ethiopia vs Eritrea**




This one’s got more backstory than Carrie and Mr Big, but basically Ethiopia’s 1962 annexation of its neighbour triggered Eritrea’s brutal 30-year war for independence, which eventually plunged Ethiopia back into its current landlocked isolation from the 1990s. 

The two were then stuck in **frozen hostility** for decades more until the current PM (Abiy) emerged in 2018 and did a historic deal with Eritrea that scored him the 2019 Nobel Prize.

But no volume of photo ops or prizes could paper over the tensions, which culminated in **Ethiopia’s startling****[letter](<https://pbs.twimg.com/media/HApMWeFXQAAwGgb.jpg>)****last week** demanding Eritrea “ _immediately withdraws its troops from Ethiopian territory and cease all forms of collaboration with rebel groups_ ”.

And to understand how we got there, we need to look at Ethiopia’s _second_ war…

  2. **Ethiopia vs Ethiopia (civil war)**




Abiy’s 2018 rise to power was a massive deal, not just because he signed the Eritrea truce, but because his ascent ended 30 years of dominance by **Ethiopia’s ethnic Tigray elites** (up north), who quickly got sidelined in the country’s military, intelligence, and beyond.

That sowed the seeds for a full-blown civil war that erupted in 2020, and **guess who helped** Abiy’s federal troops? Neighbouring Eritrea! (with its own historic Tigray beef)

So two years and endless war crimes later, Tigray lost, but **guess which troops then refused** to leave town? That’s right, neighbouring Eritrea, which voiced distrust at getting excluded from 2022’s big Tigray-Ethiopia peace deal.

But there are now signs dissident Tigray groups are active again — and **can you guess who’s reportedly helping them?** That’s right, neighbouring Eritrea! After first crushing Tigray, there are growing reports Eritrea may now be hedging its bets with some Tigray factions as a proxy front to destabilise Ethiopia. Why? To force Ethiopia to back off its persistent demands for Red Sea access via Eritrea.

And that brings us to Ethiopia’s _third_ war…

  3. **Ethiopia vs Sudan**




Thanks to some spicy Reuters [reporting](<https://www.reuters.com/investigations/ethiopia-builds-secret-camp-train-sudan-rsf-fighters-sources-say-2026-02-10/>), it turns out Ethiopia is also hosting **a secret training camp** for 4,000 members of neighbouring Sudan’s notorious Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary, which controls 40% of the country amid its own brutal civil war.

**Why would Ethiopia do that?** Just look at who is ✌️allegedly✌️ funding and staffing the camp: **the United Arab Emirates** , which denies the allegations though has been collecting East African proxies like Pokémon to secure a Red Sea footing plus gold assets, while curbing Islamist influence.

And… **why would Ethiopia help the Emiratis**? Well guess who first helped the Ethiopians against Tigray as part of its above Pokémon strategy? That’s right, the Emiratis.

So even if the above leaves you more confused than season six of _Lost_ , just hold onto **this big takeaway** : with local US power looking to draw down, you’ve got this overlapping map of history, rivalry, and proxies that risks pulling an entire region into open conflict.

And conveniently, the same country at the edge of all three wars is also the host of the African Union, which gathers for its 39th regional summit in Addis this Saturday!

#### Intrigue’s Take

So for those of us not living right there… why care? Here are three reasons, starting with…

  * **First** , the **humanitarian** implications dwarf anything else you might’ve seen in your feed, with a regional death toll approaching a ~million since Tigray, plus another ~20 million folks displaced, fuelling…

  * **Second** , continued irregular **migration** as far as Europe, playing not only into transatlantic spats with the US but also offering more fertile ground for Putin to keep backing angry voices to divide and weaken Europe, which takes us to…

  * **Third** , even if this doesn’t hit your conscience or your ballot, **it’ll hit your wallet** : the Houthis are already making Red Sea shipping (~12% of world trade) risky and therefore pricey, and these other conflicts will only further delay any stability. Plus if you want to get into specific sectors, consider Ethiopia is not only a top coffee exporter, but also has vast critical minerals shaping up as the next venue for the US-China race to secure their supply chains (something we [visited](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/zijin-mining-groups-4-billion-bet/>) last month). 




** _Sound even smarter:_**

  * Ethiopia has been the world’s most populous landlocked country since Eritrean independence stripped it of key Red Sea ports in the early 1990s. 

  * Meanwhile, the US continues to mediate another long-standing dispute involving Ethiopia’s new mega-dam, which downstream Egypt sees as a direct threat to its entire Nile water supply. 




### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇺🇸**UNITED STATES — Don’t panic.**  
The dollar index is down ahead of US employment data due out 8.30am ET today (Wednesday), with top White House advisors pre-emptively blaming the expected bad news on AI, deportations, and government cuts. ([_Yahoo Finance_](<https://finance.yahoo.com/news/we-have-to-revise-our-expectations-white-house-downplays-coming-jobs-report-200406607.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAAfOKhc8mUnIt48j3b2dhneFsQLmFO9CettGQuFNSad72ObigwcdOPtS-qFW8TdQK-shVrYjsDGMdbEujsxWhxDnu2vsv0PW3ZVVdQeS-jn1rs5iMOG_j6eNHd3B-fp__58NdnOzFeVk98SqkrbHOs03Mkt_gFZrZRIIaB46Zfw_>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_Key stats agencies are still playing shutdown catch-up, but any weak jobs numbers will add to yesterday’s disappointing retail data to sour the mood on Wall St. Talking about suspense… we're wondering what's behind the breaking US decision to_ _[halt all El Paso flights](<https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/flights-el-paso-airport-texas-halted-10-days-security-reasons-faa-rcna258497>)_ _for 10 days, citing “special security reasons“. It’s a rare order, and the location opens the possibility of (say) a_ _**cross-border cartel operation**_ _._

🇭🇺**HUNGARY — Playing dirty.**  
With polls suggesting the centre-right’s EU-friendly Péter Magyar could end Putin-friendly Orbán's 16 years in power this April, the race has taken a spectacular turn: Magyar announced overnight he expects intimate footage of him with his then-girlfriend to emerge today (Wednesday), in an attempt to discredit him. ([_Péter Magyar’s X_](<https://x.com/magyarpeterMP/status/2021267376361111883>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_The timing would make sense, distracting from the opposition’s policy launch plus the government’s own latest corruption headlines. But lest you think this is just palace intrigue, keep in mind this election will shape whether Orbán can keep blocking EU and NATO responses to Putin’s aggression against Ukraine._

🇰🇬**KYRGYZSTAN — I’m letting you go.**  
President Japarov has sacked his longtime ally (Tashiev) as security chief and deputy PM in a shock move he’s defending as crucial to _"prevent division in society."_([RFE](<https://www.rferl.org/amp/kyrgyzstan-president-reshuffle-reshuffle-political-tensions/33674256.html>))

**_Comment:_**_It looks like an attempt to curb Tashiev’s enormous influence ahead of next year’s elections, with the president presumably fearing him as a potential rival. But why now? Tashiev is in Germany getting medical treatment._

🇦🇲 **ARMENIA — Sway away from Moscow.**  
In another sign of its continued push out of Moscow’s traditional orbit, Armenia has signed a civil nuclear deal with the US during the first-ever visit by a US VP, paving the way for US tech and investment. ([Al Jazeera](<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/10/us-strikes-civil-nuclear-agreement-with-armenia-russias-former-close-ally>))

**_Comment:_**_The disintegration of Moscow’s regional influence continues apace as Putin burns everything he has against Ukraine. But the news was almost overshadowed by a Vance tweet recognising the Armenian genocide, a guaranteed way to send NATO ally Turkey ballistic, which is why the White House quickly hit delete. This was realistically a staffer stuffup rather than any shift in US position, though it’s somehow now angered both the Turks and the Armenians._

🇵🇼 **PALAU** **— Do not come.**  
The US has designated senior figures from Palau (the island’s senate president) and the Marshall Islands (an influential ex-mayor) over significant alleged corruption linked to China. They and their families are now barred from US entry. ([RNZ](<https://www.rnz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/586505/us-designates-two-micronesian-leaders-over-corruption-allegations>))

**_Comment:_**_The US statement almost spells out that this is a response to China’s regional strategy of elite capture: corrupt key players then tilt national decisions in your favour. It’s tough to counter, as the name-and-shame approach can harden entrenched powerbrokers against you instead. In this instance, it’s also worth noting these two Pacific Islands are among the few still recognising Taiwan._

🇨🇱**CHILE — LLMs for us.**  
Chile's national AI body has launched Latam-GPT, the first open-source AI language model trained on broader sources of Latin American data. Built over two years, it’s part of a regional effort to curb AI’s English language bias. ([AP](<https://apnews.com/article/chile-latam-gpt-artificial-intelligence-spanish-a2d914ff6c06b230decf930760ccb44f>))

🇪🇭**WESTERN SAHARA — Secret meeting.**  
The US has hosted ~~not-so-~~ secret talks in Madrid between the independence movement running parts of Western Sahara, the neighbour claiming it all (Morocco), and others (Algeria, Mauritania) hustling to maximise their own influence. The US seems to be pushing some version of Morocco’s UN-backed plan that’d see Western Sahara get autonomy under Moroccan sovereignty. ([Middle East Eye](<https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-holds-meeting-between-algeria-morocco-mauritania-over-western-sahara>))

🇨🇩**DR Congo — Hired guns.**  
It turns out US mercenary tycoon Erik Prince has sent troops and drones to help the Congo secure its strategic city of Uvira against the Rwanda-backed M23 armed group. It’s the first known instance of Prince’s involvement in the conflict. ([Reuters](<https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/trump-ally-prince-sent-men-drones-help-congos-army-secure-strategic-town-2026-02-10/?taid=698b87572d24c40001bd5653&utm_campaign=trueAnthem%3A+Trending+Content&utm_medium=trueAnthem&utm_source=twitter>))

**Comment** : _What’s Prince getting in return? Last year he agreed to help the Congo tax its mineral wealth, in a very similar deal to one_ _[he signed with Haiti](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/what-is-erik-prince-doing-in-haiti/>)_ _in August._

### Monks of the day

Credits: Intrigue

Washingtonians gathered on ice mounds and sidewalks across the city Tuesday as 19 Buddhist monks wrapped their 3,700km (2,300mi) walking odyssey from Texas to DC.

Affiliated with a Fort Worth outlet of Theravadism (the oldest surviving school of Buddhism), several of the monks also have roots in Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka and beyond, and have been walking every day since setting out back in October.

**Why’d they do it?** It’s been billed as a silent, non-political pilgrimage promoting inner peace, compassion, and nonviolence. 

### Today’s poll

**Yesterday’s poll:** Do you think Cuba's communists will survive this latest crisis?

✅**Yes, they're too entrenched to topple (69%)**  
❌ No, they'll be gone by year's end (28%)  
✍️ Other (write in!) (3%)

**Your two cents:**

  * ✅ **G.C:** “Time to try carrot and stick diplomacy, instead of just being loud with a big stick.”

  * ❌ **R.O:** “Cuba may have finally run out of friends willing to defy US pressure. And US pressure is going to increase as the administration looks for a win with currently disaffected Latino voters.”
