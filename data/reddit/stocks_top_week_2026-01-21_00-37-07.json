        "selftext": "President Donald Trump announced Saturday that he will be suing the investment banking company JPMorgan Chase within “the next two weeks” for allegedly “DEBANKING” him after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection.\n\nTrump has claimed that the investment bank closed or restricted his accounts following the riot, effectively cutting him off from longstanding banking relationships. He has framed the action as politically motivated retaliation, arguing banks acted under pressure from the Biden administration. Trump has increasingly folded this into a broader narrative of “debanking” conservatives.\n\nJPMorgan has denied closing accounts for political reasons.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon had been floated for Treasury secretary by the president, but their relationship has since soured. Trump in August went after Dimon’s bank, as well as Bank of America, accusing them of discriminating against him in recent years.\n\nEarlier in 2025, the Trump Organization sued Capital One, accusing the bank of improperly cutting off access to the business, which was founded by the president’s late father and was helmed by Trump himself before he entered politics, following the Capitol attack.\n\nThe president also took issue with a Wall Street Journal story, which reported that he offered the Federal Reserve chair position to Dimon. “A front page Article in The Fake News Wall Street Journal states, without any verification, that I offered Jamie Dimon, of JPMorgan Chase, the job of Fed Chairman. This statement is totally untrue, there was never such an offer,” Trump wrote in his Truth Social post.\n\n“Why wouldn’t The Wall Street Journal call me to ask whether or not such an offer was made? I would have very quickly told them, ‘NO,’ and that would have been the end of the story,” Trump added in the post. “Why would I give it to Jamie? No such offer was made there, or even thought of, either. The Wall Street Journal ought to do better ‘fact checking,’ or its already strained credibility will continue to DIVE.”\n\nTrump seemed to be pointing to a story from the Journal published Wednesday, which reported that Trump offered Dimon the role earlier last year. Dimon took that as a joke, according to the Journal, citing people briefed on the discussion.\n\nDimon, asked in an interview with Bloomberg published Thursday whether he’d take the role, said: \"Absolutely, positively no chance, no way, no how, for any reason.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Dimon, dismissing his warnings that the Justice Department’s criminal probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell, for whom the bank CEO said he has “enormous respect,” could threaten central bank independence. Tensions escalated further as JPMorgan publicly opposed Trump’s proposal to cap credit-card interest rates, with bank executives warning the move would shrink credit and hurt consumers.\n\n\"It would be very bad for consumers, very bad for the economy,\" JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jeremy Barnum told reporters on the bank’s earnings call last Tuesday.",

The usual argument is that the US deserves a \"Trust Premium.\" We have the stable government, the reserve currency, and the predictable policy. You pay a luxury tax for US stocks because it's the safe haven.\n\nBut that trust is evaporating. We are watching the stability of the US erode in real time. With Trump's erratic behavior and policy by tweet, the \"predictable\" part of the US thesis is gone.\n\nIf the US acts like a volatile emerging market, it shouldn't trade at a safety premium. Why pay 20x or 25x earnings for slow growth US companies when the political risk is skyrocketing?\n\nThe real asymmetry is abroad.\n\n\\- China: You have tech monopolies with actual growth trading at 8x or 9x earnings.\n\n\\- South America/Europe: Massive discounts.\n\n\\- US: You pay a huge premium for \"safety\" while the political landscape gets more irrational by the day.\n\nThe valuation gap is closing, and it will continue to close as long as we have the DUmp in the white house.\n\nThis is why I think looking for \"value\" in the US right now is a mistake. People keep asking if beaten down stocks like PYPL or ADBE are value plays. They aren't. US market will probably continue to be on a relative decline (which has been for the last year) as long as the current policies persists.\n\nEDIT:\n\n1. Relative decline means that US market went up significantly less than ex-US markets. Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%.  Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors.\n\n2. People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge.\n\nBut looking long term, I think we're coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding:\n\n\\- Education is slipping. You can't have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We're relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage.\n\n\\- Basic research is drying up. The \"inventing\" part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&amp;D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&amp;D now, but they focus on next quarter's profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry.\n\nWe are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.",

Case in point VXUS is up 30% over the last year while VTI is up less than 15%.  Taking into account of USD value dropping, US stock market has barely moved up over the last year for many international investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;People are right to point out about MAG7 companies and US still holds a lead technologically and still have the dynamism edge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But looking long term, I think we&amp;#39;re coasting on momentum and eating our seed corn. The foundations that built that advantage are eroding:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Education is slipping. You can&amp;#39;t have tech dominance without a skilled workforce, and we are failing to produce it locally. US math scores in rankings dropped 30th place worldwide. We&amp;#39;re relying entirely on importing talent, which Trump is doing his best to discourage.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;- Basic research is drying up. The &amp;quot;inventing&amp;quot; part used to be funded by the government (Internet, GPS, early biotech). Federal R&amp;amp;D spend has crashed. Corporations do R&amp;amp;D now, but they focus on next quarter&amp;#39;s profit, not the deep science that creates the next industry.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;We are great at harvesting the crop right now, but we stopped planting the next field.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Canada is forging a “new strategic partnership” with China, its second-biggest trading partner, Prime Minister Mark Carney said Friday during what he called a “historic” trip to Beijing. That includes a break with the United States on tariffs, which have hit both the Canadian and Chinese economies. Carney, the first Canadian prime minister to visit China since 2017, met with President Xi Jinping at the Great Hall of the People. He is one of a series of world leaders shaken by President Donald Trump’s geopolitical disruptions who are traveling to Beijing as it seeks to exploit U.S. unpredictability to bolster its global influence. For Canada, the Trump administration has been especially head-spinning. “The United States used to be a friend and ally,” Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China, told NBC News in an interview. Now, “we are treated as an enemy.”\n\n&gt; As part of an effort to “recalibrate” the relationship, Carney said Canada had agreed to cut its 100% tariff on Chinese electric cars in return for lower tariffs on Canadian farm products. It’s a major shift for Canada, a major auto producer that in 2024 followed the U.S. in imposing the 100% tariff. Carney said Canadians would also be allowed to travel to China visa-free.\n\n&gt; Canadian officials say they are seeking to grow non-U.S. trade by at least 50% over the next 10 years. “Further trade engagement with China should first and foremost be seen as diversification away from the United States,” Ong said. About 75% of Canada’s manufactured goods exports go to the U.S., according to government figures. China is the second-largest market at about 4%.",

Perfect for ditching overpriced US stocks.\n* **Weak won + export boost:** KRW stayed soft, supercharging export-heavy firms with higher margins, earnings beats, and stock re-ratings.\n* **Concentrated market amps up % gains:** Fewer mega-caps, but giants like these explode the overall cap.\n\nQuick shoutout to Spain's +64.5% killer run, thanks to:\n\n* Booming banks (IBEX heavyweight, low rates juicing lending)\n* \\~3% GDP surge (beating Euro peers on jobs/investment)\n* Tourism explosion (post-COVID come back)\n* Infrastructure boom (EU funds for housing/projects)\n* Credit upgrades (Moody's/Fitch/S&amp;P drawing investors)\n* Edge in cheap energy/resilient exports\n\nYou invested in Korean stocks last year.

If you keep reading mainstream media, r/stocks, and listening to Michael Burry, you'd believe it.\n\nYou'd be losing a lot of money though.\n\n**Real demand is through the roof:**\n\n* H100 prices recovering to highest in 8 months. This is a clear indicator that Burry's claim that old GPUs become useless faster than expected is wrong. Source mvcinvesting @ X. Can't post link here due to X being banned.\n\n* Burry’s logic to short Nvidia is especially dumb. So he short Nvidia because he thinks old GPUs will be obsolete faster than expected because new Nvidia GPUs will be so much better. If companies all buy Nvidia’s new GPUs, Nvidia wins. If no one buys Nvidia’s new GPUs, then there is no faster than expected obsoletion. You can’t have rapid obsoletion of old GPUs without buying a ton of new Nvidia GPUs. Do people not see the glaring issue? Burry’s short reason is completely illogical. The only reason to short Nvidia is if you think demand for compute will fall. We’re clearly not seeing this. \n\n* China's Alibaba Justin Lin just said they're severely constrained by inference demand. He said Tencent is the same. They simply do not have compute to meet user demand. They're having to use their precious compute for inference which does not leave enough to train new models to keep up with Americans. Their models are falling behind American ones for this reason. Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-10/china-ai-leaders-warn-of-widening-gap-with-us-after-1b-ipo-week\n\n* Google says they need to double compute every 6 months to meet demand. Source: https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/21/google-must-double-ai-serving-capacity-every-6-months-to-meet-demand.html\n\n* You can clearly see the accelerating AI demand from OpenAI’s reported revenue numbers. OpenAI is already at $20b/year in revenue and without monetizing their free users. In 2024, their revenue grew by 2.5x. In 2025, their revenue grew by 4x. So it's not slowing down. If they grow 4x again in 2026, they're already at $100b/year in revenue. Sources: https://epoch.ai/data-insights/openai-revenue https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/06/sam-altman-says-openai-will-top-20-billion-annual-revenue-this-year.html\n\nNotice how compute is always followed by \"demand\". It's real demand. It's not a circular economy. It's truly real user demand. \n\nListen to people actually are close to AI demand. They're all saying they're compute constrained. Literally everyone does not have enough compute. Every software developer has experienced unreliable inference when using Anthropic's Claude models because Anthropic simply does not have enough compute to meet demand. \n\n**So why is demand increasing?**\n\n* Because contrary to popular belief on Reddit, AI is tremendously useful even at the current intelligence level. Every large company I know is building agents to increase productivity and efficiency. Every small company I know is using some form of AI whether it's ChatGPT or video gen or software that has added LLM support.\n\n* Models are getting smarter faster. It’s not slowing down. It’s accelerating. In the last 6 months, GPT5, Gemini 3, and Claude 4.5 have increased capabilities faster than expected. The intelligence graph is now exponential, not linear. Source 1: https://metr.org/blog/2025-03-19-measuring-ai-ability-to-complete-long-tasks Source 2: https://arcprize.org/leaderboard\n\n* There are reasons to believe that the next generation of foundational models from OpenAI and Anthropic will accelerate again. GPT5 and Claude 4.5 were still trained on H100 GPUs or H100-class chips. The next gen will be trained on Blackwell GPUs.\n\n* LLMs aren't just chat bots anymore. They're trading stocks, doing automated analysis, writing apps from scratch, solving previously unsolved math conjectures, and is already showing signs of self improvement (read what people in industry are saying last few months on self improvement). The token usage has exploded. If you think LLMs are still just used for chatting about cooking recipes or summarizing emails, you are truly missing the forest for the trees. \n\n* AI models are becoming so smart that they’re starting to solve previously unsolved math problems. Here’s Terence Tao, one of the smartest humans alive, explaining how GPT 5.2 solved an Erdos math problem: https://mathstodon.xyz/@tao/115855840223258103\n\n* There is a reason US productivity grew faster than expected in Q3 2025 and is accelerating. Productivity has grown the fastest since 2023 when Covid mostly ended. Source: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/us-productivity-picked-up-in-third-quarter-labor-costs-declined\n\nAt some point, the AI bubble will peak. Anyone who thought it peaked in 2025 is seriously going to regret it. When it does pop, it's still going to be bigger than it was in 2025. The world will not use less AI or require less compute than 2025. We're going to have exponential increase in AI demand.\n\nIf you’re still skittish about investing in AI stocks, then just invest in S&amp;P500. All companies will benefit from AI productivity boost. Do not stay out of the market because you think the AI bubble will burst soon.\n\nStop listening to the mass media on AI. They’re always anti-tech. Always. They were anti-tech before AI boom. They will be after. Negative stories get views and engagement. AI could find a cure for a disease but they'll write about how AI hallucinated that one time. Follow the people who are actually working on AI. \n\nI’ll close with this: Railroad bubble in the US peaked at 6% of GDP spend. AI is at 1% right now.",
