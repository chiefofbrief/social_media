        "selftext": "I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned since buying my first stock in 1995, when I was only 17 years old. I believe the 7 lessons below is why most people fail to win their financial freedom through investing.\n\n1️⃣ Lack of Discipline and Patience  \nMany investors chase quick returns and lack the patience to hold quality investments over time. As the famed investor Jesse Livermore noted over a century ago: \"It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I've known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.\"\n\n2️⃣ Emotional Conditioning  \nFear drives people to sell in downturns, while greed leads them to buy at peaks. Investing is a highly counter-intuitive process: the best time to buy is when you're most fearful, and the best time to sell is when you're most excited. \\[This is basically Buffet's classic quote of being fearful when others are greedy, and vice versa\\]. \n\n3️⃣ Investing in Stocks Instead of Companies  \nMost people think of stocks as standalone entities rather than ownership stakes in businesses. Stock price movements mean little without context. Focus on the companies, not their trading proxies.\n\n4️⃣ Investing in Companies Instead of People  \nBuilding on the previous point, companies are ultimately a reflection of the people running them. We don’t invest in logos or buildings, we invest in people. Over the long run, the difference between a good company and a great one is always the people.\n\n5️⃣ Confusing Speculation with Investing  \nMany investors buy stocks without understanding the business, its valuation, or its long-term prospects. If you don’t understand why you own something, you won’t be able to hold it through market cycles. \\[There is nothing wrong with speculation if you are into that, but don't confuse it with investing!\\].\n\n6️⃣ \"This Time Is Different!\"  \nThis phrase echoes through every bubble be tech in the late 1990s, housing in the early 2000s, or AI today. Keep in mind it is NEVER different, when asset prices materially diverge from fundamentals, they end up reverting back to the mean. Investing into a bubble is no different from playing musical chairs with your capital.\n\n7️⃣ Over-Diversifying at the Outset  \nTo build significant wealth, especially early on, a degree of concentration is required. As Buffett famously said: \"Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth.\". If your goal is early retirement, you need to get comfortable making concentrated bets, assuming, that you’ve internalized the previous six lessons.\n\nTo learn the above, I paid in sweat, tears, and many millions I made, lost, and made again. Hopefully, some of the above will shorten your path to financial freedom. And I am happy to learn about your own lessons in the comments section.",

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ll share some of the lessons I’ve learned since buying my first stock in 1995, when I was only 17 years old. I believe the 7 lessons below is why most people fail to win their financial freedom through investing.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1️⃣ Lack of Discipline and Patience&lt;br/&gt;\nMany investors chase quick returns and lack the patience to hold quality investments over time. As the famed investor Jesse Livermore noted over a century ago: &amp;quot;It never was my thinking that made the big money for me. It always was my sitting. Got that? My sitting tight! It is no trick at all to be right on the market. You always find lots of early bulls in bull markets and early bears in bear markets. I&amp;#39;ve known many men who were right at exactly the right time, and began buying or selling stocks when prices were at the very level which should show the greatest profit. And their experience invariably matched mine--that is, they made no real money out of it. Men who can both be right and sit tight are uncommon.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2️⃣ Emotional Conditioning&lt;br/&gt;\nFear drives people to sell in downturns, while greed leads them to buy at peaks. Investing is a highly counter-intuitive process: the best time to buy is when you&amp;#39;re most fearful, and the best time to sell is when you&amp;#39;re most excited. [This is basically Buffet&amp;#39;s classic quote of being fearful when others are greedy, and vice versa]. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3️⃣ Investing in Stocks Instead of Companies&lt;br/&gt;\nMost people think of stocks as standalone entities rather than ownership stakes in businesses. Stock price movements mean little without context. Focus on the companies, not their trading proxies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;4️⃣ Investing in Companies Instead of People&lt;br/&gt;\nBuilding on the previous point, companies are ultimately a reflection of the people running them. We don’t invest in logos or buildings, we invest in people. Over the long run, the difference between a good company and a great one is always the people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;5️⃣ Confusing Speculation with Investing&lt;br/&gt;\nMany investors buy stocks without understanding the business, its valuation, or its long-term prospects. If you don’t understand why you own something, you won’t be able to hold it through market cycles. [There is nothing wrong with speculation if you are into that, but don&amp;#39;t confuse it with investing!].&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;6️⃣ &amp;quot;This Time Is Different!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\nThis phrase echoes through every bubble be tech in the late 1990s, housing in the early 2000s, or AI today. Keep in mind it is NEVER different, when asset prices materially diverge from fundamentals, they end up reverting back to the mean. Investing into a bubble is no different from playing musical chairs with your capital.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;7️⃣ Over-Diversifying at the Outset&lt;br/&gt;\nTo build significant wealth, especially early on, a degree of concentration is required. As Buffett famously said: &amp;quot;Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth.&amp;quot;. If your goal is early retirement, you need to get comfortable making concentrated bets, assuming, that you’ve internalized the previous six lessons.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;To learn the above, I paid in sweat, tears, and many millions I made, lost, and made again. Hopefully, some of the above will shorten your path to financial freedom. And I am happy to learn about your own lessons in the comments section.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

The \"Hidden\" valuation - The headline P/E is misleading. If you strip out the $380B+ cash pile and the stock portfolio, you are effectively paying \\~10-12x for the operating businesses. Comparable industrial companies trade at 20x. You are getting high quality assets at a discount.\n2. The ultimate active fund - The market is super uncertain right now. With BRK you get top-tier capital allocation for free. I'd rather have Buffett and Abel steering the ship than mostly passive index that holds a lot of overvalued junk.\n3. The Free Put - You have a massive cash pile earning 4% interest. This is basically a free put option on the market. If the economy tanks, Berkshire has $350B to buy distressed assets. You have huge upside if the market crashes, and you get paid to wait if it doesn't. Even if the bull market continues for a long time berkshire should at least matches inflation with portfolio companies such as BSNF (railway) and BHE (energy).\n\nOnly downside is that buffet retiring have people worry, but it's overblown. Greg Abel has been running the actual operations for years anyway. The machine is built and runs itself. The stock is already trading so cheap that the \"Buffett premium\" is gone. The transition is already priced in.\n\nIf you want to get rich (or poor) quickly, chase these \"hot\" AI stocks. If you want to stay rich and grow for cheap, BRK is the obvious play. It's a hedge against the rest of your portfolio blowing up.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit:\n\nMade a mistake of double counting the interest income pointed out by u/Longjumping-Fact-582\n\nIf you subtract the cash pile ($380B) from the valuation to make the stock look cheaper, you must also subtract the interest income (\\~$15B) from the earnings.\n\nThe operating PE is actually about \\~15-16x, still relatively cheap, but not as cheap as I thought it was. Still I think the main argument is valid, that it is relatively cheap compared to the market and gives  the balance sheet and capital allocation option if things get messy",

If you strip out the $380B+ cash pile and the stock portfolio, you are effectively paying ~10-12x for the operating businesses. Comparable industrial companies trade at 20x. You are getting high quality assets at a discount.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The ultimate active fund - The market is super uncertain right now. With BRK you get top-tier capital allocation for free. I&amp;#39;d rather have Buffett and Abel steering the ship than mostly passive index that holds a lot of overvalued junk.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;The Free Put - You have a massive cash pile earning 4% interest. This is basically a free put option on the market. If the economy tanks, Berkshire has $350B to buy distressed assets. You have huge upside if the market crashes, and you get paid to wait if it doesn&amp;#39;t. Even if the bull market continues for a long time berkshire should at least matches inflation with portfolio companies such as BSNF (railway) and BHE (energy).&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Only downside is that buffet retiring have people worry, but it&amp;#39;s overblown. Greg Abel has been running the actual operations for years anyway. The machine is built and runs itself. The stock is already trading so cheap that the &amp;quot;Buffett premium&amp;quot; is gone. The transition is already priced in.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you want to get rich (or poor) quickly, chase these &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; AI stocks. If you want to stay rich and grow for cheap, BRK is the obvious play. It&amp;#39;s a hedge against the rest of your portfolio blowing up.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Edit:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Made a mistake of double counting the interest income pointed out by &lt;a href=\"/u/Longjumping-Fact-582\"&gt;u/Longjumping-Fact-582&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you subtract the cash pile ($380B) from the valuation to make the stock look cheaper, you must also subtract the interest income (~$15B) from the earnings.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The operating PE is actually about ~15-16x, still relatively cheap, but not as cheap as I thought it was. Still I think the main argument is valid, that it is relatively cheap compared to the market and gives  the balance sheet and capital allocation option if things get messy&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Nike shares are down about 25% this year and are below where they stood 10 years ago, as the sneaker maker struggled to get back on track.\n\nNike shares fell over 10% in the wake of the profit report for the company’s second fiscal quarter ending in November last week.\n\nWrite to Andrew Bary at andrew.bary@barrons.com",

Many investors feared that a bear market was just around the corner after two years of extraordinary returns. I examined what the history had taught us and examined the prevailing economic landscape and I concluded that it was best for investors to remain invested in the stock market. That post attracted nearly 700,000 views so I will now provide an update.\n\nMy thesis has been vindicated so far, as the S&amp;P 500 has offered a total return of 18% so far in 2025. Nevertheless, the big question is whether the S&amp;P 500 has become risky after three consecutive years of outsized returns. This question is particularly critical now that so many investors and analysts are calling an “AI bubble” and warn that a bear market is imminent. Just like in the previous article, it will be interesting to examine what history has taught us after three consecutive years of outsized returns and combine this with the current economic landscape.\n\nThere have been only two instances in which the S&amp;P surged more than 20% for two consecutive years and offered a positive return during the third year. The first occasion was in 1954-1956. The S&amp;P 500 offered a 45% return in 1954 and a 26% return in 1955. It gained another 3% in 1956. In addition, it incurred a 14% correction in 1957 but it surged 38% in 1958. Therefore, it was highly risky to attempt to time the market back then because most market timers would have risked missing a long-term bull market, with excessive returns until 1972.\n\nThe other period, which is much more similar to the current one, was in 1995-1997. The S&amp;P 500 surged 34% in 1995, 20% in 1996 and 31% in 1997. The primary catalyst behind that breathtaking bull market was the advent of internet. Many investors were fearing that a bubble had formed and thus remained on the sidelines but the market punished harshly those who tried to time the market. The S&amp;P 500 kept rallying impressively, with a 27% rally in 1998 and 20% in 1999.\n\nThere are great similarities between the rally in 1995-1997 and the rally in 2023-2025. The former was fueled primarily by the advent of the internet, which was a game changer for productivity and hence for economic growth and corporate profits. Many investors were skeptical due to the sky-high valuation levels of many internet stocks back then. Indeed, many internet stocks failed to live up to expectations and went out of business or caused hefty losses to their shareholders. That’s why the stock market went through a severe bear market from 2000 to early 2003.\n\nHowever, the internet proved to be a game changer for the long run, not thanks to internet providers but thanks to some tech juggernauts who took advantage of internet and grew their profits immensely. Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG) would not have reached market caps of $1.7 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively, without the use of the internet. Overall, while many internet providers and other internet-related stocks burst like bubbles, the internet turned out to be a major catalyst for the long-term growth of the economy and corporate earnings thanks to its positive impact on productivity and the immense boost to the earnings of many companies, which took advantage of the new technology.\n\nA similar picture is evident today, with artificial intelligence (AI) instead of the internet. The exceptional rally since early 2023 has been fueled primarily by the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence. Many investors claim that some AI providers have sky-high valuation levels and hence their stocks are prone to collapse, just like the stocks of many internet stocks in 2000. Indeed, it is likely that many AI-related stocks will turn out to be bubbles.\n\nHowever, investors should not dismiss AI as a catalyst for long-term growth. Some technological giants are likely to take advantage of the various capabilities that AI will offer them and grow their profits immensely. NVIDIA (NVDA), which has reached a market cap of $4.4 trillion, is just an example but many other companies are likely to benefit from AI as well. To cut a long story short, in a similar fashion to the advent of the internet, the stock market many not benefit directly from AI providers but it is likely to greatly benefit from the tech juggernauts that will take advantage of AI and grow their profits massively.\n\nIt is also important to realize that it has proved impossible to time the market successfully on a regular basis. Since the beginning of 2009, the S&amp;P has offered an average annual total return of 13% but numerous analysts and investors have been calling a collapse of the stock market throughout the 17-year period. Those who remained on the sidelines due to their fear of an “upcoming market crash” have been severely punished.\n\nMoreover, investors should note that the economic landscape has markedly changed since 2022, after 14 years of negligible inflation. Inflation skyrocketed to a 40-year high in 2022 and, even though it has moderated, it has proved persistent since then. As a result, bonds have become less attractive, as the real (after inflation) yield of investment grade bonds is lackluster.\n\nInstead, the S&amp;P 500 is a great investing vehicle for those who seek protection against inflation. Due to inflation, many companies raise their prices and expand their profits, thus providing a boost to the S&amp;P 500. While the index has offered an average annual total return of approximately 10% over the long run, it has offered an average annual total return of 14.4% over the last five years. While the extraordinary returns have been fueled primarily by the ongoing technological boom, inflation has played a role as well.\n\nTo conclude, history has shown that it is best to remain invested in the S&amp;P 500, even after three consecutive years of outsized returns. There is no guarantee that 2026 will prove just another year with stellar returns but the S&amp;P 500 is likely to keep offering great returns over the long run. Therefore, investors should resist the temptation to try to time the market, particularly in the inflationary environment prevailing right now.\n\nIf you find the above interesting, you are also likely to find the below investing book interesting:\n\n[Amazon.com: Investing in Stocks &amp; Bonds: The Early Retirement Project Book 1: 9798324607845: Papadatos, Aristofanis, Economou, Apostolos: Books](https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FInvesting-Stocks-Bonds-Retirement-Project%2Fdp%2FB0D47BPY9J%2Fref%3Dsr_1_2%3Fcrid%3DA6TP86FIOHAE%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.swBwg3oQQ93Omj04kVW78JFjKEkmzWW23GdNLh-_4DLGjHj071QN20LucGBJIEps.fPFuWZ_mnjEvC81uTjVx9ctHgwlmeWSBeFYJZEUD9IA%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Daristofanis%2Bpapadatos%26qid%3D1737741097%26s%3Dbooks%26sprefix%3Daristofanis%2Bpapadato%252Cstripbooks-intl-ship%252C201%26sr%3D1-2&amp;data=05%7C02%7CAPapadatos%40helpe.helleniq.gr%7C35e3b98340ab4594408308de3e69b4e6%7Ca3c7896ff6e54683b7f814ad0f128eac%7C0%7C0%7C639016820884790306%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJFbXB0eU1hcGkiOnRydWUsIlYiOiIwLjAuMDAwMCIsIlAiOiJXaW4zMiIsIkFOIjoiTWFpbCIsIldUIjoyfQ%3D%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=BXQFjBp7qSbtrrVh5UtKghrrcmpoewQrc1SsdVLfWlw%3D&amp;reserved=0)",

This isn't a typo or some weird accounting anomaly, this is just where we're at in 2026.\n\nThis is a somewhat longer pitch, skip to the bottom for TLDR if you want. \n\nFor those unfamiliar, the common description of MELI is Amazon plus PayPal in Latin America. This is a bit of an oversimplification, but it's directionally accurate. Obviously PayPal comparisons aren't going to excite anyone who's seen a 5y performance chart, but there's good reason why Mercado Pago has a much more durable moat than PayPal's legacy network. \n\nThere are two main pillars of the MELI business, with a series of other rapidly emerging segments that you could arguably either separate or include in those pillars.\n\nEcommerce is the bedrock of the business today, as their MercadoLivre platform acts very similarly to the Amazon marketplace but with an even larger majority of sales being third party listings, rather than MELI proprietary goods (first party). They make their money by providing sellers the listing, storage, and transportation of goods to end customers, and taking a cut in the process. Their main markets are Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, with small but growing footprints in other LATAM nations. \n\nThe second pillar, Mercado Pago, started as a simple payment network. This was remarkably successful because a huge portion of Latin America is unbanked, and effectively opened the door for these people to access the world of ecommerce. Similar to the PayPal-eBay relationship, it started as a way to get these customers transacting on the Ecommerce platform, but has since expanded far beyond the walls of MELI itself. If you buy anything online or in person in South America, there's a solid chance that one of the top checkout options is Mercado Pago, right next to credit cards and other country-specific solutions. \n\nCrucially, there is a flywheel effect between these two things. The Ecommerce site acts as a funnel to encourage people toward Pago, which is a broadly accepted/trusted solution that MELI can monetize even outside their walled garden. MercadoPago also acts as a bridge for MELI to get the under banked population to seemlessly shop on their platform without a huge hassle. The more users on either platform, the better each gets. \n\nAs for those emerging segments I mentioned? Credit is the most notable right now, followed by ads. Mercado Credito allows MELI to lock sellers into their ecosystem by funding their business operations. They have a huge underwriting advantage by having access to their sales data (they're already conducting their business through Mercadolivre), and can specify certain conditions like using Mercado Pago as their payment network in order to receive the funding. \n\nAs for advertising, it's the same playbook as Amazon. Interestingly, Amazon's advertising revenue as a percentage of GMV is around 7-8%, whereas MELI's is currently around 2%. It's not a guarantee, but it definitely seems like there is room to expand the *extremely* high margin ads business, if AMZN is anything to go off of.\n\nThis post is already a bit wordy, so I'll just briefly say that the financials are absolutely incredible. &gt;10x revenue growth since COVID, gross margins in the mid 40's (great for an Ecommerce business), healthy balance sheet, basically no dilution of shares. Look at the charts yourself, I promise you will be amazed at the consistency and speed of growth. As I mentioned, it's the only company in the world with &gt;22 consecutive quarters of &gt;30% revenue growth. Currently, it trades at 30x EV/EBIT, but true profitability (adjusting for huge loan loss provisions that disproportionately affect earnings) is probably somewhere between around 20-25x \"mature\" margins. The valuation discussion is tough with this name, but I'm happy to discuss with anyone in the comments if there are objections/questions. \n\n\n-----TLDR-----\nYou're getting a wide moat, diversified business with a huge runway ahead, growing 40% for 30x EV/EBIT. There is notable competition in LATAM, but MELI continues to execute at a world class level, and the management is absolutely top notch. The risk/reward feels amazing here, and I forsee this moving from my #3 to my #1 holding over the coming months. Hope you guys enjoyed the writeup, lemme know your thoughts! ",

Their main markets are Brazil, Mexico, and Argentina, with small but growing footprints in other LATAM nations. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The second pillar, Mercado Pago, started as a simple payment network. This was remarkably successful because a huge portion of Latin America is unbanked, and effectively opened the door for these people to access the world of ecommerce. Similar to the PayPal-eBay relationship, it started as a way to get these customers transacting on the Ecommerce platform, but has since expanded far beyond the walls of MELI itself. If you buy anything online or in person in South America, there&amp;#39;s a solid chance that one of the top checkout options is Mercado Pago, right next to credit cards and other country-specific solutions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Crucially, there is a flywheel effect between these two things. The Ecommerce site acts as a funnel to encourage people toward Pago, which is a broadly accepted/trusted solution that MELI can monetize even outside their walled garden. MercadoPago also acts as a bridge for MELI to get the under banked population to seemlessly shop on their platform without a huge hassle. The more users on either platform, the better each gets. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for those emerging segments I mentioned? Credit is the most notable right now, followed by ads. Mercado Credito allows MELI to lock sellers into their ecosystem by funding their business operations. They have a huge underwriting advantage by having access to their sales data (they&amp;#39;re already conducting their business through Mercadolivre), and can specify certain conditions like using Mercado Pago as their payment network in order to receive the funding. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As for advertising, it&amp;#39;s the same playbook as Amazon. Interestingly, Amazon&amp;#39;s advertising revenue as a percentage of GMV is around 7-8%, whereas MELI&amp;#39;s is currently around 2%. It&amp;#39;s not a guarantee, but it definitely seems like there is room to expand the &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; high margin ads business, if AMZN is anything to go off of.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This post is already a bit wordy, so I&amp;#39;ll just briefly say that the financials are absolutely incredible. &amp;gt;10x revenue growth since COVID, gross margins in the mid 40&amp;#39;s (great for an Ecommerce business), healthy balance sheet, basically no dilution of shares. Look at the charts yourself, I promise you will be amazed at the consistency and speed of growth. As I mentioned, it&amp;#39;s the only company in the world with &amp;gt;22 consecutive quarters of &amp;gt;30% revenue growth. Currently, it trades at 30x EV/EBIT, but true profitability (adjusting for huge loan loss provisions that disproportionately affect earnings) is probably somewhere between around 20-25x &amp;quot;mature&amp;quot; margins. The valuation discussion is tough with this name, but I&amp;#39;m happy to discuss with anyone in the comments if there are objections/questions. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;-----TLDR-----\nYou&amp;#39;re getting a wide moat, diversified business with a huge runway ahead, growing 40% for 30x EV/EBIT. There is notable competition in LATAM, but MELI continues to execute at a world class level, and the management is absolutely top notch. The risk/reward feels amazing here, and I forsee this moving from my #3 to my #1 holding over the coming months. Hope you guys enjoyed the writeup, lemme know your thoughts! &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

        "selftext": "I’m new to this subreddit, but not new to investing. That said, I’ve noticed that many people here, even if they’re familiar with this subreddit, are just starting out  especially judging by the number of posts like *“Will this stock go up?”*\n\nSo I wanted to share a few lessons from my own modest experience. The last time I did this here, I genuinely enjoyed reading your comments, and I’m glad some people learned something from it.  \nFor those who commented *“Here we go again, another guy trying to prove he’s smarter than everyone else”*  sorry, that’s not my intention. If you already feel confident in what you’re doing, this post might simply not be for you.\n\n\n\n# 1. One solid framework is better than five flashy ones.\n\nIn value investing, focus on one proven approach, such as Benjamin Graham’s principles (margin of safety, low P/E, etc.) or a simple variation like discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.  \nAt the beginning, you want to try everything: complex screeners, exotic ratios, multiple valuation models. The result is usually random and inconsistent decisions.\n\nOnce you find a core framework and apply it successfully across a few investments, simplify it. Create clear rules or a checklist to evaluate companies. Move away from technical charts (mostly useless here) and focus on balance sheets and cash flows.\n\nI know it’s working when I *don’t* buy a stock because it breaks my rules, even if it looks “promising.” Caution pays off, and doing nothing is often the best decision.\n\n\n\n# 2. Newcomers: no one is a genius, but learning saves a lot of money.\n\nNo one is born a great investor. That’s exactly why learning matters , it helps you avoid unnecessary and expensive mistakes. I bring this up because I constantly see newcomers, and there will always be more.\n\nRecently, we’ve seen crypto exchanges massively expand into traditional assets like stocks, gold, and silver. For example, Bitget added over 200 tokenized stocks and ETFs in just a few months at the end of 2025 and early 2026, with exploding volumes (already exceeding $15 billion in US stock futures). At the same time, Nasdaq is pushing for SEC approval to offer tokenized stocks directly on its platform, potentially by late 2026.\n\nThese innovations are exciting, but if you’re not already comfortable with a market , whether traditional equities, tokenized stocks, or hybrid crypto-TradFi products , don’t rush in. Take time to learn the rules, the specific risks (liquidity, regulation, custody, 24/7 volatility), and the emotional biases these new tools introduce.\n\nBeginners who jump in without solid foundations often pay a high price for their impatience. Patient learning (reading, paper backtesting, observing multiple cycles) is your best shield. In value investing, the real edge comes from time, not speed.\n\n\n\n# 3. Risk management is the strategy.\n\nThis is often discussed in value investing, but not always applied. What truly changed things for me was treating risk as a fixed cost per investment.\n\nThat means a maximum loss per position (for example, never risking more than 1–2% of your portfolio on a single stock), consistent rules across investments, and diversification (no more than 10–15% in one sector). No exceptions, even when “this one looks different.”\n\nOnce your downside is controlled, your edge can finally play out. In value investing, the main risk isn’t daily volatility but fundamental mispricing  which is why a strict margin of safety (buying at 50–70% of estimated intrinsic value) matters so much.\n\n\n\n# 4. Your worst investments come from boredom, not bad analysis.\n\nSome of my biggest losses didn’t come from poor fundamental analysis, but from forcing interpretations. They were investments made without a real opportunity.\n\nValue traps are usually emotional, not analytical. If you hit “buy” just to feel involved, you’re playing roulette. Learning to do nothing is a real skill, and it took me longer to master than reading financial statements.\n\nOn r/valueinvesting, you often see posts about “undervalued” stocks bought out of FOMO or boredom during flat markets. Avoid that.\n\n\n\n# 5. Track your emotions, not just your trades.\n\nMost people keep an investment journal (buys, sells, screenshots). That’s good. What helped me most was writing down how I felt before and during each purchase.\n\nWas I rushed? Trying to recover a previous loss? Overconfident after a win? Over time, you start seeing the same emotional patterns behind the same bad decisions. Fix those, and your results improve  without changing your strategy.\n\nIn value investing, exits are often passive (long holding periods), so focus your journal on entries: why the stock is undervalued, and how your emotions influenced that judgment.\n\n\n\n# 6. Consistency comes from routine, not motivation.\n\nMotivation fades quickly. Routine stays. Same research schedule. Same preparation time. Same small ritual before reviewing annual reports.\n\nI stopped waiting to feel “ready” and just followed the process. Some days are positive, some negative, and many are flat. The goal is to make investing boring enough that emotions stop interfering.\n\n\n\n**In summary**, value investing became much simpler once I stopped trying to outsmart the market and started managing myself instead. If you’re just starting out, don’t rush  especially into new areas like tokenized assets. Early success is about survival.\n\nProtect your capital, stack small wins, and let time do the heavy lifting.\n\nStay disciplined. The money will follow.\n\nIf you’re interested, r/valueinvesting remains one of the best places to explore these ideas through serious discussions and deep fundamental analysis.

Avoid that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Track your emotions, not just your trades.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Most people keep an investment journal (buys, sells, screenshots). That’s good. What helped me most was writing down how I felt before and during each purchase.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Was I rushed? Trying to recover a previous loss? Overconfident after a win? Over time, you start seeing the same emotional patterns behind the same bad decisions. Fix those, and your results improve  without changing your strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In value investing, exits are often passive (long holding periods), so focus your journal on entries: why the stock is undervalued, and how your emotions influenced that judgment.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Consistency comes from routine, not motivation.&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Motivation fades quickly. Routine stays. Same research schedule. Same preparation time. Same small ritual before reviewing annual reports.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I stopped waiting to feel “ready” and just followed the process. Some days are positive, some negative, and many are flat. The goal is to make investing boring enough that emotions stop interfering.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In summary&lt;/strong&gt;, value investing became much simpler once I stopped trying to outsmart the market and started managing myself instead. If you’re just starting out, don’t rush  especially into new areas like tokenized assets. Early success is about survival.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Protect your capital, stack small wins, and let time do the heavy lifting.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Stay disciplined. The money will follow.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you’re interested, &lt;a href=\"/r/valueinvesting\"&gt;r/valueinvesting&lt;/a&gt; remains one of the best places to explore these ideas through serious discussions and deep fundamental analysis.

        "selftext": "End of the year is a good time to look back, reflect and second guess the decisions you made.  What were yours?  I'll share mine.\n\n1. My worst performing stocks were low-PE purchases, and my best performing stocks had high PEs.  For example, I purchased four REITS...IRT, AMH, MAA, WELL...and the cheapest ones did the worst in order!  Ben Graham famously warned against owning stocks with trailing GAAP PE's  over 15...yet none of my best investment had non-gaap forward PE's under 20 (eg AMD, CLS, FN, MLI, DOCN, AMKR).  IMO a gaap trailing &lt; 15 PE stock is actually a warning sign that something is seriously wrong.\n2. I learned not to buy stocks just after earnings day losses.   I didn't realize it at the time, but there is a concept in finance that says a stock that crashes after earnings day will continue to do so (usually) for a few weeks (PEAD).  If you want in...you need to just wait for it to climb down. In May $EXP had disappointing earnings and dropped from 241 to 227 where I bought.  But then it continued to drop for the next month to 197.  Ouch.\n3. I learned not to buy momentum stocks.  eg I got caught up in the rare earth hype cycle and bought MP at 46.32.  It would go onto hit 98 dollars...but I was horrified when I did the DCF that the numbers didn't add up for even 46 dollars.  I sold at a profit of 67.28...and am glad I did.  It trades now at 54.65.  You should always do either DCF or earnings projections for stocks you want to buy...otherwise you're speculating and not investing.\n4. I learned the importance of AI with research.  Yes, it makes mistakes...but you can ask for citations and cross check its information.   The speed and depth of information provided is too important to ignore.   For example, I was close to purchasing $GFS yesterday, but noticed an odd gap down in the share price.  I asked Grok what happened, and it explained that the US paused tariffs on Chinese semis until 2027...which represented a signifant threat to GFS.  I held off my purchase.  This was especially impressive as this was a very recent new story, that other LLMs (like Gemini) and financial media sources I subscribed too completely missed.  Most users will use AI to find bullish information...that's a mistake though...as LLM's are much stronger at identifying bearish information.  Next time, you're in Gemini or Grok, ask it to convince you NOT to invest in the company you are interested in (ChatGPT is trash).  You will learn a LOT.\n5. Timing the market vs time in the market.  I did invest during the April dip, but not fully.  I kept waiting for the market to coming back down each week, but it didn't...so I gave up in May and invested my remaining reserves then.  It was a good thing I did so.   Not saying it's 100% wrong to have cash reserves and to wait for some crashes...but IMO, this should only be a small % of your portfolio.  It's just too dangerous being outside the stock market for too many days.",

I&amp;#39;ll share mine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;My worst performing stocks were low-PE purchases, and my best performing stocks had high PEs.  For example, I purchased four REITS...IRT, AMH, MAA, WELL...and the cheapest ones did the worst in order!  Ben Graham famously warned against owning stocks with trailing GAAP PE&amp;#39;s  over 15...yet none of my best investment had non-gaap forward PE&amp;#39;s under 20 (eg AMD, CLS, FN, MLI, DOCN, AMKR).  IMO a gaap trailing &amp;lt; 15 PE stock is actually a warning sign that something is seriously wrong.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I learned not to buy stocks just after earnings day losses.   I didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, but there is a concept in finance that says a stock that crashes after earnings day will continue to do so (usually) for a few weeks (PEAD).  If you want in...you need to just wait for it to climb down. In May $EXP had disappointing earnings and dropped from 241 to 227 where I bought.  But then it continued to drop for the next month to 197.  Ouch.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I learned not to buy momentum stocks.  eg I got caught up in the rare earth hype cycle and bought MP at 46.32.  It would go onto hit 98 dollars...but I was horrified when I did the DCF that the numbers didn&amp;#39;t add up for even 46 dollars.  I sold at a profit of 67.28...and am glad I did.  It trades now at 54.65.  You should always do either DCF or earnings projections for stocks you want to buy...otherwise you&amp;#39;re speculating and not investing.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;I learned the importance of AI with research.  Yes, it makes mistakes...but you can ask for citations and cross check its information.   The speed and depth of information provided is too important to ignore.   For example, I was close to purchasing $GFS yesterday, but noticed an odd gap down in the share price.  I asked Grok what happened, and it explained that the US paused tariffs on Chinese semis until 2027...which represented a signifant threat to GFS.  I held off my purchase.  This was especially impressive as this was a very recent new story, that other LLMs (like Gemini) and financial media sources I subscribed too completely missed.  Most users will use AI to find bullish information...that&amp;#39;s a mistake though...as LLM&amp;#39;s are much stronger at identifying bearish information.  Next time, you&amp;#39;re in Gemini or Grok, ask it to convince you NOT to invest in the company you are interested in (ChatGPT is trash).  You will learn a LOT.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Timing the market vs time in the market.  I did invest during the April dip, but not fully.  I kept waiting for the market to coming back down each week, but it didn&amp;#39;t...so I gave up in May and invested my remaining reserves then.  It was a good thing I did so.   Not saying it&amp;#39;s 100% wrong to have cash reserves and to wait for some crashes...but IMO, this should only be a small % of your portfolio.  It&amp;#39;s just too dangerous being outside the stock market for too many days.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
