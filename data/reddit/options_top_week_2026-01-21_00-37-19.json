        "selftext": "Hey r/options,\n\nI’m the developer behind [ThetaScanner](https://thetascanner.com/).\n\nI built this platform because I was tired of the existing options scanners on the market. Most were either absurdly expensive or lacked the specific combination of features I needed for selling options.\n\nI found myself opening 15 different tabs just to check IV, earnings dates, technicals, and fundamentals to validate a single trade. I wanted a specific tool designed for Theta strategies (The Wheel, CSPs, Covered Calls) that consolidated that workflow into one place without spending hundreds of dollars a year.\n\nThe goal of theta strategies isn't just to find the highest premium, because high premium usually means high risk. It is to find the best risk-adjusted premium on quality underlying stocks, and that's what this tool tries to achieve.\n\n# What it actually does\n\nThe platform analyzes over 200,000 options contracts on 1400+ tickers to help find income-focused setups. It combines market data with technicals and fundamentals to help you stay away from yield traps.\n\n* The Scanner: This is the main dashboard. You can filter contracts by Strike, DTE, ROI, Delta, Theta, IV, Annualized Yield, and a lot more.\n   * Liquidity Control: You can specifically filter by Open Interest and Bid/Ask Spread to ensure you aren't trading illiquid garbage that you can't close. Illiquid contracts are automatically filtered out.\n   * Fundamental &amp; Technical Filters: Screen by P/E, EPS, Market Cap, Dividend Yield, RSI, Moving Averages, and more.\n* Curated Market Views: If you don't want to set manual filters, you can view the Top Yields (highest return), Most Traded (highest volume/OI), and ThetaScanner Picks (Algo-curated setups) pages to see what the market is focusing on.\n* CSP &amp; Covered Call Finders: These are dedicated tools for the Wheel Strategy. You can toggle between \"Safe\", \"Balanced\" , and \"Income\" strategies to see annualized returns based on your risk tolerance. For CSP finder, different filters are available based on your objectives and capital.\n* Earnings Calendar: Navigating earnings season is critical for sellers. The scanner flags upcoming earnings and lets you strictly filter out contracts that expire during a binary event to avoid assignment risk.\n\n# ThetaScanner In-House Algo Scores\n\nI didn't want to just display raw data, so I built three proprietary algorithms to help sort the noise. I want to be transparent about how these work so you know what you are looking at:\n\n1. ThetaScanner Rating: This looks at the underlying stock itself. It analyzes multiple data points including technicals (moving averages, relative strength, etc.) and fundamentals (P/E ratios, beta, short float, etc.). It penalizes high volatility or bad financials and rewards stability. It’s basically designed to answer: \"Is this a stock I wouldn't mind owning if I get assigned?\"\n2. ThetaScanner Option Score: This looks at the specific contract. It takes the Stock Rating above and blends it with individual option data like Delta, Open Interest, earnings dates, etc. Ideally, this points you toward that sweet spot (usually around .25 Delta) with good liquidity.\n3. Relative Strength: This compares the stock's performance against the SP500 and 1,400+ other tickers on the platform. It helps identify if the stock is trending with the market or lagging behind.\n\n# Pricing and Free Tier\n\nI know nobody likes a tool that is entirely paywalled, and I want people to actually use it, so the free tier is generous.\n\n* Free Tier: You get full access to the scanner and filtering for major tickers (SPY, QQQ, AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, etc.). If you only trade the big names, you can use the tool for free forever.  We also offer limited access to the other features.\n* Pro ($5.99/mo): Unlocks all 1,400+ tickers and all the features mentioned plus more. I wanted to make this tool as accessible as possible, because that's what i had been looking for and couldn't find. The yearly plan is just $60/year.\n\nSince this post is for this community, I created a special promo code: ROPTIONS. It gives you a one-time 30% discount, which you can apply to either the first month or the full annual plan (bringing the yearly cost down to $42, just $3.50/mo). \n\nAll data on the platform is updated every \\~10 minutes for both tiers.\n\n# Coming Soon\n\nI am currently finalizing a full Trading Journal feature integrated directly into the platform, which is scheduled to go live later this month.\n\nI’m looking for genuine feedback. If you think the scoring is off, or if there’s a specific filter missing that you need for your strategy, let me know in the comments.\n\nLink to the platform: [thetascanner.com](https://thetascanner.com/)\n\nOur subreddit: r/ThetaScanner \n\nHappy trading,  \nThe ThetaScanner Team",

Have Mara calls expiring next Friday and ouster calls also expiring next Friday. Last time I tried trading ouster, I lost $1600. Also have $50 calls on iren expiring next Friday too, I was up over 40% on them yesterday but now down/even on it lol. Anyways, if anyone got any ideas let me know.",

So far it seems like I have bad decisions. Anyone got any recommendations? I feel like I’m better off putting my money into a slot machine at this point but don’t want to give up. P&amp;amp;L is -6% for today so far. Have Mara calls expiring next Friday and ouster calls also expiring next Friday. Last time I tried trading ouster, I lost $1600. Also have $50 calls on iren expiring next Friday too, I was up over 40% on them yesterday but now down/even on it lol. Anyways, if anyone got any ideas let me know.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Let's say for arguments sake, I:\n\nAm excellent at reading price action and have very good risk mgmt\n\nI have ...$50k of capital to deploy daily.\n\nI want it to be relatively stress free. no white knuckling.\n\nI want to start small, get better, increase knowledge and comfort and increase size.\n\nQuestions:\n\nShould I be just selling calls if I am anticipating a downturn? And selling puts if I think we rally north? Or\n\nShould i be utilizing some spread? Should I be utilizing a different instrument if i expect chop? Should I be focused on delta?\n\nIs there a good time of day to do this and how long should I be in if I just want to collect the juiciest premiums for a short while without exposing myself to end of day volatility?  OR is this just way too complicated for a regular day trader and i should avoid altogether. Thanks!",

I am wondering though, if can I get *fairly* low risk return selling 0DTE options?

And selling puts if I think we rally north? Or&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Should i be utilizing some spread? Should I be utilizing a different instrument if i expect chop? Should I be focused on delta?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Is there a good time of day to do this and how long should I be in if I just want to collect the juiciest premiums for a short while without exposing myself to end of day volatility?

We use the same DTE as a look back period. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).\n    \n- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from negative (bearish) to positive (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.\n\n- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.\n\n- **Expiration:** 2026-01-23.\n\n- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are \"cheaper.\" High numbers mean options are \"expensive.\"\n\n- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.\n\n- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.\n\n- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have \"weeklies\", the underlying is \"too cheap\", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",

        "selftext": "Firstly, this is listed on the London Stock Exchange, its not ASC the shipping company, I'm talking about ASOS PLC.\n\nCurrent Market Cap: £340m\n\nCash on Hand: £318m\n\nRevenue: £2.46bn\n\nCash runway to 2030+ and flipping FCF positive.\n\nThey currently have over 20m active customers worldwide, primarily operating in the UK, Europe and United States. With completely automated fulfilment warehouses in Barnsley, UK.\n\nTheir recent launch of ASOS world, their app, already has over 1m UK active users.\n\nThe CEO began a 3 year revival plan in 2023 and so far the results have been as promised. A huge increase in margins, focus towards profitability, debt re-structure that gives them 5 years+ of runway and a return to profitability.\n\nOf all the companies, across all markets, that produce over $1b+ in revenue a year its ASOS that comes out by far the best value.\n\nWhich means they're trading at a Price to sales of 0.13, almost 3 times cheaper than popular bargain names like JD.com\n\nIn fact, it's so cheap that on its current path every point in margin increase provides substantial buyback power. We're seeing exactly that, with its Adjusted EBIDTA up 60% and Margins up 45-47%\n\nLooking at these figures one would assume a capitalist investor would want to buy this company out, which is what got me digging and leads me to believe that's exactly what will happen. With bankruptcy off the cards for a least 5 years.\n\nI've been trading full time for 14 years now and I've seen/played a lot of buyout \"rumours\", thereby studying a lot of names that do actually get bought out. One of the most common occurrences prior to takeover is what we're seeing below.\n\nNearly 70% of the float is owned by 2 funds and the third (the Chairman of ASOS). Now Frasers group makes for a good contender but they have actually offered before (which the CEO rejected).\n\nOwned by Danish Billionaire Anders Povlsen, who also happens to own an international fashion group inc the likes of Jack Jones and Vero Moda. A buyout of ASOS would solidify his family's empire and likely become the flagship of his fund. By merging his current portfolio and no longer competing with ASOS on fast fashion.\n\nFrasers group is owned by billionaire Mike Ashley, who happens to own Sports Direct, House of Fraser, Flannels, Jack Wills, Game and many more. Again ASOS would be a strategic buyout here.\n\nSoley owned by the Chairman of ASOS and a prolific buyer in recent months, inc November, December and even January this year.\n\nIt feels like these three plays are all competing to get a controlling share.\n\nEvery time Ive seen this type of top heavy share accumulation it leads to a buyout; Just like Walgreens, EA, Skechers, Metro AG and TKO holding WWE, they all saw the exact same mass accumulation of shares right before and into a premium buyout offer.\n\nNow those are just the top 3, The other interesting option is a buyout from Asia, names like TEMU and others have attempted multiple times to get a listing on the UK stock exchange. A buyout of ASOS would give them access to European distribution, a well established brand AND listings on the London Stock Exchange.\n\nNow I could be way off the mark here but given they have cash runway until 2030+ and given it's literally one of the most underpriced $1bn+ revenue stocks listed (on any exchange worldwide) it feels worth a punt.\n\nEspecially given how cheap the options are trading for. If you checking the open interest there's one big buyer of March £4 (400 as it's listed in pennies for UK stocks) with 1,000 OI (1m shares, options are multiples of 1,000 in the UK). With basically no other OI which is extremely odd.. Now just like unusual whales points out, somebody always knows and given the recent 25% straight bounce, increase in volume and this recent block buy of calls it stinks of a buyout.\n\nBased on current options price, if that were to happen by March, the options payout is insane. With the equivalent leverage between 50 and 100/1\n\nTake a look into it and see what you think, I plan on buying some more calls and shares (Incase it doesn't happen as soon as I feel).",

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firstly, this is listed on the London Stock Exchange, its not ASC the shipping company, I&amp;#39;m talking about ASOS PLC.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Current Market Cap: £340m&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash on Hand: £318m&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Revenue: £2.46bn&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Cash runway to 2030+ and flipping FCF positive.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;They currently have over 20m active customers worldwide, primarily operating in the UK, Europe and United States. With completely automated fulfilment warehouses in Barnsley, UK.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Their recent launch of ASOS world, their app, already has over 1m UK active users.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The CEO began a 3 year revival plan in 2023 and so far the results have been as promised. A huge increase in margins, focus towards profitability, debt re-structure that gives them 5 years+ of runway and a return to profitability.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Of all the companies, across all markets, that produce over $1b+ in revenue a year its ASOS that comes out by far the best value.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Which means they&amp;#39;re trading at a Price to sales of 0.13, almost 3 times cheaper than popular bargain names like JD.com&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s so cheap that on its current path every point in margin increase provides substantial buyback power. We&amp;#39;re seeing exactly that, with its Adjusted EBIDTA up 60% and Margins up 45-47%&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Looking at these figures one would assume a capitalist investor would want to buy this company out, which is what got me digging and leads me to believe that&amp;#39;s exactly what will happen. With bankruptcy off the cards for a least 5 years.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been trading full time for 14 years now and I&amp;#39;ve seen/played a lot of buyout &amp;quot;rumours&amp;quot;, thereby studying a lot of names that do actually get bought out. One of the most common occurrences prior to takeover is what we&amp;#39;re seeing below.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nearly 70% of the float is owned by 2 funds and the third (the Chairman of ASOS). Now Frasers group makes for a good contender but they have actually offered before (which the CEO rejected).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Owned by Danish Billionaire Anders Povlsen, who also happens to own an international fashion group inc the likes of Jack Jones and Vero Moda. A buyout of ASOS would solidify his family&amp;#39;s empire and likely become the flagship of his fund. By merging his current portfolio and no longer competing with ASOS on fast fashion.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Frasers group is owned by billionaire Mike Ashley, who happens to own Sports Direct, House of Fraser, Flannels, Jack Wills, Game and many more. Again ASOS would be a strategic buyout here.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Soley owned by the Chairman of ASOS and a prolific buyer in recent months, inc November, December and even January this year.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;It feels like these three plays are all competing to get a controlling share.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Every time Ive seen this type of top heavy share accumulation it leads to a buyout; Just like Walgreens, EA, Skechers, Metro AG and TKO holding WWE, they all saw the exact same mass accumulation of shares right before and into a premium buyout offer.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now those are just the top 3, The other interesting option is a buyout from Asia, names like TEMU and others have attempted multiple times to get a listing on the UK stock exchange. A buyout of ASOS would give them access to European distribution, a well established brand AND listings on the London Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Now I could be way off the mark here but given they have cash runway until 2030+ and given it&amp;#39;s literally one of the most underpriced $1bn+ revenue stocks listed (on any exchange worldwide) it feels worth a punt.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Especially given how cheap the options are trading for. If you checking the open interest there&amp;#39;s one big buyer of March £4 (400 as it&amp;#39;s listed in pennies for UK stocks) with 1,000 OI (1m shares, options are multiples of 1,000 in the UK). With basically no other OI which is extremely odd.. Now just like unusual whales points out, somebody always knows and given the recent 25% straight bounce, increase in volume and this recent block buy of calls it stinks of a buyout.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Based on current options price, if that were to happen by March, the options payout is insane. With the equivalent leverage between 50 and 100/1&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Take a look into it and see what you think, I plan on buying some more calls and shares (Incase it doesn&amp;#39;t happen as soon as I feel).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

I tried searching up how IBKR calculates/gets these values but couldn't find any useful info and got quite confused. I hope maybe someone here could help me. For example:\n\n1) What is \"IV Last\" and what expiry and what strike is it referring to?\n\n2) Same thing with IV / Hist Vol. Again, what timeframe is being used for Hist Vol and what strike/expiry for IV?\n\n  \n3)What is \"IV CI\" and \"Hist Vol CIs\"\n\n  \nThank you very much",

New to understanding options. I tried searching up how IBKR calculates/gets these values but couldn&amp;#39;t find any useful info and got quite confused. I hope maybe someone here could help me. For example:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1) What is &amp;quot;IV Last&amp;quot; and what expiry and what strike is it referring to?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;2) Same thing with IV / Hist Vol. Again, what timeframe is being used for Hist Vol and what strike/expiry for IV?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;3)What is &amp;quot;IV CI&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Hist Vol CIs&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Since they are steady growth ETF's, I've been holding them, up/down markets and have been growing.  SInce I'm approaching the expiration in 6 months, my choices are  1. Roll them to 2027 or 2028 with 70 or 80 delta's again, which I've been doing  2. Sell to take profit and wait for the dips  3. In June, exercise and take the possession of SPY and QQQ at strike price (450 ish).  SInce I'm trying to build base portfolio using SPY and QQQ, I'm leaning towards option 3.  \n\nAny suggestion would be appreciated.\n\n",
