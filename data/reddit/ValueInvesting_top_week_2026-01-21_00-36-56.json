        "selftext": "I've been posting my thesis for some of the stocks below on why I think they are undervalued, feel free to roast me or not, although I feel pretty secure about them.\n\n**1. Amaroq Minerals ($AMRQ)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Amaroq has successfully transitioned from \"explorer\" to \"producer,\" recently beating FY25 gold production guidance. The real story is strategic: The West is desperate to secure critical minerals (Gold/Copper) outside of Chinese influence, and Amaroq effectively owns the rights to South Greenland.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** The Phase 2 plant upgrade lands in Q2 2026. This boosts recovery rates to \\~90%, turning this into a cash-flow machine just as gold prices hold historic highs.\n\n**2. Ferrari ($RACE)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Stop looking at P/E ratios; this trades like Hermès, not Ford. The order book is entirely sold out through 2026. Their customer base is immune to interest rates and inflation, and they have arguably the strongest pricing power of any company on earth.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Lewis Hamilton’s second season in Red + the imminent launch of their first EV. The market expects the EV to be sold out before the public even sees it.\n\n**3. Aston Martin ($AML)**\n\n* **Thesis:** The contrarian pick. The stock has been battered, creating a distressed valuation (0.4x sales). The thesis relies entirely on the successful delivery of the *Valhalla* supercar in 2026 and debt stabilization.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** If they deliver cars on time this year, the stock re-rates from \"bankruptcy risk\" to \"luxury brand.\" High risk, massive potential upside.\n\n**4. Fluor ($FLR)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Fluor has \"de-risked\" its backlog—82% of its contracts are now reimbursable (meaning the client pays for cost overruns, not Fluor). They are the ones actually building the data centers for hyperscalers and have a massive footprint in the Nuclear/SMR renaissance.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Aggressive share buybacks continuing through Feb 2026 and the monetization of their NuScale (SMR) stake.\n\n**5. L3Harris ($LHX)**\n\n* **Thesis:** Unlike the slow-moving \"metal benders\" (Lockheed/Northrop), LHX focuses on the high-growth tech layer of defense: space, cyber, and comms. They are the \"trusted disruptor\" in a sector seeing increased budget allocation.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** The planned spin-off of their Missile Solutions unit later in 2026. This unlocks shareholder value and leaves a leaner, higher-margin tech core.\n\n**6. Capital One ($COF)**\n\n* **Thesis:** The play is the Discover acquisition. By owning the Discover network, COF creates a closed-loop system (issuer + network) that lets them bypass Visa/Mastercard fees and capture the entire transaction margin. Even without it, it’s a tech-forward bank trading at a value multiple. (10% C/C Cap Highly Unlikely to go through)\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Realizing the projected $2.7B in synergies.\n\n**7. NextEra Energy ($NEE)**\n\n* **Thesis:** AI Data centers consume an insane amount of electricity. NextEra is the largest renewable developer in the US and the only one with the scale (\\~30GW backlog) to power the AI boom. You get the safety of a regulated utility (Florida Power &amp; Light) attached to a high-growth tech play.\n* **2026 Catalyst:** Confirmed 10% dividend growth through 2026 and massive demand from hyperscalers (Google/Microsoft) signing long-term power purchase agreements.",

The \"Hidden\" valuation - The headline P/E is misleading. If you strip out the $380B+ cash pile and the stock portfolio, you are effectively paying \\~10-12x for the operating businesses. Comparable industrial companies trade at 20x. You are getting high quality assets at a discount.\n2. The ultimate active fund - The market is super uncertain right now. With BRK you get top-tier capital allocation for free. I'd rather have Buffett and Abel steering the ship than mostly passive index that holds a lot of overvalued junk.\n3. The Free Put - You have a massive cash pile earning 4% interest. This is basically a free put option on the market. If the economy tanks, Berkshire has $350B to buy distressed assets. You have huge upside if the market crashes, and you get paid to wait if it doesn't. Even if the bull market continues for a long time berkshire should at least matches inflation with portfolio companies such as BSNF (railway) and BHE (energy).\n\nOnly downside is that buffet retiring have people worry, but it's overblown. Greg Abel has been running the actual operations for years anyway. The machine is built and runs itself. The stock is already trading so cheap that the \"Buffett premium\" is gone. The transition is already priced in.\n\nIf you want to get rich (or poor) quickly, chase these \"hot\" AI stocks. If you want to stay rich and grow for cheap, BRK is the obvious play. It's a hedge against the rest of your portfolio blowing up.\n\nThoughts?\n\nEdit:\n\nMade a mistake of double counting the interest income pointed out by u/Longjumping-Fact-582\n\nIf you subtract the cash pile ($380B) from the valuation to make the stock look cheaper, you must also subtract the interest income (\\~$15B) from the earnings.\n\nThe operating PE is actually about \\~15-16x, still relatively cheap, but not as cheap as I thought it was. Still I think the main argument is valid, that it is relatively cheap compared to the market and gives  the balance sheet and capital allocation option if things get messy",

I know im contributing to the amount of people commenting on the downfall of this sub, but we need to have some guidelines or something at the least cuz im sick of coming here and seeing wall street bets.\n\nEdit: I dont want to be the person im complaining about so heres some stock im personally all in on (feel free to debate if its \"value\" but i refuse to speculate too much), some true value, and some \"cigar butts\", not financial advice do ur own dd.

RCL: Great consumer cyclical, low PE again growing super fast.\n\nFor the value, ABT, ACGL, PGR, NEM, ALL, CINF, CTRA. All below 15 PE, most have good dividends, relatively low debt. Probably wouldnt invest personally though, and a extremely deep value cigar butt im all in right now is ACHC, DD is pretty deep value, GPN deep value, KHC deep value.

        "selftext": "So, there is actually a statistically sound study on Multibaggers (stocks that did 5x, 10x, or even 100x in stock price). I spent the last days going through **Anna Yartseva’s paper “Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks”**, which looked at **464 NYSE/Nasdaq stocks** that went on to deliver big multi‑year returns from **2009 to 2024**. It’s one of the few studies that actually uses **panel regression models**, so there is some actual data behind it... Let's break it down - I found it very insightful:\n\n# 1. What didn’t predict the big winners\n\nA few things most people assume matter… didn’t:\n\n* **Earnings growth** (EPS, EBIT, EBITDA, net income, gross profit) over *1‑year or 5‑year windows* didn’t show predictive power.\n* **Sector bias** was pointless. Winners were spread across IT, industrials, consumer, healthcare… even a few utilities.\n* **Dividends**, **buybacks**, **analyst coverage**, **R&amp;D intensity**, **Altman Z‑score**, **debt ratios:** none of these had a consistent statistical link to future outperformance.\n\nBasically: screening for “fast growers,” “undiscovered stocks,” or “tech only” would have filtered out plenty of actual multibaggers.\n\n# 2. The strongest signal by far: FCF/Price\n\nThis was the standout result.\n\n* **Free cash flow to price (FCF/P)** had the *largest coefficients* in the regressions.\n* **Book‑to‑Market (B/M)** (which is Book Value per Share / Market Price per Share) helped explain which stocks became long‑term winners better than models without it.\n* When both improved together, the annual return impact was substantial.\n\nThat means:  \n**Starting cheap on free cash flow** mattered more than almost anything else.\n\nBut watch out:  \n**Firms with negative equity** massively underperformed across all size buckets.\n\n# 3. Size: small companies dominated\n\nMedian “starting point” for winners:\n\n* **$348M market cap**\n* **$702M revenue**\n\nSmall caps outperformed mid‑caps and large‑caps by a wide margin.  \nThe size effect was one of the cleanest patterns in the study.\n\n# 4. Profitability: modest, but improving\n\nThe typical winner didn’t start off with extraordinary profitability:\n\n* **ROE \\~9%**\n* **EBIT margin \\~3.9%**\n* **ROC \\~6.5%**\n* **Gross margin \\~35%**\n\nThe important part was the trend: Winners tended to *improve* these metrics over time.  \nEarnings growth happened later, but wasn’t a reliable predictor upfront.\n\n# 5. Revenue growth was fine, but not the “edge”\n\nMedian long‑term revenue growth was around **11%**, but again:  \nit wasn’t the variable that separated future multibaggers from the pack.\n\nThe “engine” wasn’t rapid revenue growth, but **cash generation (positive FCF) + valuation (aka multiple expansion) + improving margins** (aka margin expansion).\n\n# 6. Reinvestment quality\n\nAn interesting result:\n\nIf **asset growth exceeded EBITDA growth**, future returns dropped noticeably.\n\nCompanies that aggressively expanded the balance sheet without equivalent earnings progress tended to disappoint.\n\nWhy? Because it usually means one of three things:\n\n* a. The company is spending a lot… but not producing much\n* b. The business isn’t earning good returns on new investments\n* c. Management is chasing scale to hide weak economics\n\n# 7. Entry points and price behavior\n\nSome practical points:\n\n* Stocks trading **near 12‑month lows** at the buy point had better outcomes(!) They started their run from bottoms.\n* **1‑month momentum** was slightly positive. Meaning: if the stock was up last month, it tended to continue a bit.\n* **3–6 month momentum** was negative (mean reversion). Meaning: over the medium term, strong recent performance was actually a red flag.\n* Many winners had choppy, non‑linear price paths -&gt; Multibaggers almost never look like multibaggers in real time.\n\nNothing “smooth” about the journey... Keep holding, if the foundamentals stay in tact...\n\n# 8. Macro conditions\n\nRising interest rates reduced next‑year returns by roughly **8–12%** for potential winners.\n\nSmaller companies are more rate‑sensitive, so this fits:  \nhigher discount rates → lower valuations → tougher conditions. Meaning: if you expect interest rates to fall, it's a better time to invest.\n\n# A simple screen based on her findings\n\nIf you wanted to build a starting list based strictly on what her models highlighted, it would look like:\n\n* High **FCF/Price** (5% FCF yield or more)\n* **B/M &gt; 0.40** and **positive operating profitability**\n* **Market cap &lt; $2B**\n* Profitability **improving** (margins and returns trending up)\n* **Asset growth ≤ EBITDA growth**\n* Trading **near 12‑month lows**\n* No **negative equity**\n\n# TL;DR\n\nYartseva’s study in one message:\n\nMultibaggers start small, look cheap on free cash flow, show improving economics, reinvest well, and are usually bought during dull moments — not hype cycles.\n\nLet me know if you are surprised by some of these metrics\n\nDo you screen for some of those metrics when you research?",

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, there is actually a statistically sound study on Multibaggers (stocks that did 5x, 10x, or even 100x in stock price). I spent the last days going through &lt;strong&gt;Anna Yartseva’s paper “Alchemy of Multibagger Stocks”&lt;/strong&gt;, which looked at &lt;strong&gt;464 NYSE/Nasdaq stocks&lt;/strong&gt; that went on to deliver big multi‑year returns from &lt;strong&gt;2009 to 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. It’s one of the few studies that actually uses &lt;strong&gt;panel regression models&lt;/strong&gt;, so there is some actual data behind it... Let&amp;#39;s break it down - I found it very insightful:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;1. What didn’t predict the big winners&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A few things most people assume matter… didn’t:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earnings growth&lt;/strong&gt; (EPS, EBIT, EBITDA, net income, gross profit) over &lt;em&gt;1‑year or 5‑year windows&lt;/em&gt; didn’t show predictive power.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sector bias&lt;/strong&gt; was pointless. Winners were spread across IT, industrials, consumer, healthcare… even a few utilities.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividends&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;buybacks&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;analyst coverage&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;R&amp;amp;D intensity&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Altman Z‑score&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;debt ratios:&lt;/strong&gt; none of these had a consistent statistical link to future outperformance.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Basically: screening for “fast growers,” “undiscovered stocks,” or “tech only” would have filtered out plenty of actual multibaggers.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;2. The strongest signal by far: FCF/Price&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the standout result.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Free cash flow to price (FCF/P)&lt;/strong&gt; had the &lt;em&gt;largest coefficients&lt;/em&gt; in the regressions.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book‑to‑Market (B/M)&lt;/strong&gt; (which is Book Value per Share / Market Price per Share) helped explain which stocks became long‑term winners better than models without it.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;When both improved together, the annual return impact was substantial.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;That means:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Starting cheap on free cash flow&lt;/strong&gt; mattered more than almost anything else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;But watch out:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;strong&gt;Firms with negative equity&lt;/strong&gt; massively underperformed across all size buckets.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;3. Size: small companies dominated&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Median “starting point” for winners:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$348M market cap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;$702M revenue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Small caps outperformed mid‑caps and large‑caps by a wide margin.&lt;br/&gt;\nThe size effect was one of the cleanest patterns in the study.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;4. Profitability: modest, but improving&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The typical winner didn’t start off with extraordinary profitability:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROE ~9%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EBIT margin ~3.9%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ROC ~6.5%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gross margin ~35%&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The important part was the trend: Winners tended to &lt;em&gt;improve&lt;/em&gt; these metrics over time.&lt;br/&gt;\nEarnings growth happened later, but wasn’t a reliable predictor upfront.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;5. Revenue growth was fine, but not the “edge”&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Median long‑term revenue growth was around &lt;strong&gt;11%&lt;/strong&gt;, but again:&lt;br/&gt;\nit wasn’t the variable that separated future multibaggers from the pack.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The “engine” wasn’t rapid revenue growth, but &lt;strong&gt;cash generation (positive FCF) + valuation (aka multiple expansion) + improving margins&lt;/strong&gt; (aka margin expansion).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;6. Reinvestment quality&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;An interesting result:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If &lt;strong&gt;asset growth exceeded EBITDA growth&lt;/strong&gt;, future returns dropped noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Companies that aggressively expanded the balance sheet without equivalent earnings progress tended to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Why? Because it usually means one of three things:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;a. The company is spending a lot… but not producing much&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;b. The business isn’t earning good returns on new investments&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;c. Management is chasing scale to hide weak economics&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;7. Entry points and price behavior&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Some practical points:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Stocks trading &lt;strong&gt;near 12‑month lows&lt;/strong&gt; at the buy point had better outcomes(!) They started their run from bottoms.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1‑month momentum&lt;/strong&gt; was slightly positive. Meaning: if the stock was up last month, it tended to continue a bit.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3–6 month momentum&lt;/strong&gt; was negative (mean reversion). Meaning: over the medium term, strong recent performance was actually a red flag.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many winners had choppy, non‑linear price paths -&amp;gt; Multibaggers almost never look like multibaggers in real time.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Nothing “smooth” about the journey... Keep holding, if the foundamentals stay in tact...&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;8. Macro conditions&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Rising interest rates reduced next‑year returns by roughly &lt;strong&gt;8–12%&lt;/strong&gt; for potential winners.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Smaller companies are more rate‑sensitive, so this fits:&lt;br/&gt;\nhigher discount rates → lower valuations → tougher conditions. Meaning: if you expect interest rates to fall, it&amp;#39;s a better time to invest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;A simple screen based on her findings&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;If you wanted to build a starting list based strictly on what her models highlighted, it would look like:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;High &lt;strong&gt;FCF/Price&lt;/strong&gt; (5% FCF yield or more)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B/M &amp;gt; 0.40&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;positive operating profitability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market cap &amp;lt; $2B&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Profitability &lt;strong&gt;improving&lt;/strong&gt; (margins and returns trending up)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asset growth ≤ EBITDA growth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Trading &lt;strong&gt;near 12‑month lows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;No &lt;strong&gt;negative equity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;h1&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h1&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Yartseva’s study in one message:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Multibaggers start small, look cheap on free cash flow, show improving economics, reinvest well, and are usually bought during dull moments — not hype cycles.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Let me know if you are surprised by some of these metrics&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you screen for some of those metrics when you research?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Basically I build a consensus list.  \n  \nA stock had to be recommended by at least 4 different YouTubers to make the cut. The Result: A list of 14 stocks.\n\nThe Top 3 Most Recommended ( I know that's all you cared) are:\n\n1. **Google** (Alphabet)\n2. **SoFi**\n3. **Amazon**\n\nAs a YouTuber myself, I know how much research goes into my videos, but I’m also aware that many creators have ulterior motives, chase views, sponsorships or - worse - might be pushing paid pumps from certain companies.\n\nDo you think a \"Consensus List\" like this actually has value as a \"Wisdom of the Crowds\" metric? Or is it just an echo chamber? Do you like the top 3 for this year? Personally, I’m curious to see if this basket of 14 stocks will beat the S&amp;P 500 in 2026.\n\nI’m not posting this to get views (the video is doing incredible with the Youtube algo, and I honestly prefer you just comment here on Reddit) but if you want to watch it:  \n[I Watched 200 Finance Videos.

        "selftext_html": "&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey Guys, two weeks ago, I posted about tracking YouTuber returns from last year &amp;quot;best picks&amp;quot;  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1q42c8p/i_tracked_the_returns_of_16_popular_stock/\"&gt;I tracked the returns of 16 popular Stock YouTubers from 2025&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This week, I went down the rabbit hole and watched 200+ videos to aggregated the &amp;quot;Top Picks for 2026&amp;quot; from over 50 different channels. Basically I build a consensus list.  &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A stock had to be recommended by at least 4 different YouTubers to make the cut. The Result: A list of 14 stocks.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Top 3 Most Recommended ( I know that&amp;#39;s all you cared) are:&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; (Alphabet)&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SoFi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As a YouTuber myself, I know how much research goes into my videos, but I’m also aware that many creators have ulterior motives, chase views, sponsorships or - worse - might be pushing paid pumps from certain companies.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do you think a &amp;quot;Consensus List&amp;quot; like this actually has value as a &amp;quot;Wisdom of the Crowds&amp;quot; metric? Or is it just an echo chamber? Do you like the top 3 for this year? Personally, I’m curious to see if this basket of 14 stocks will beat the S&amp;amp;P 500 in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I’m not posting this to get views (the video is doing incredible with the Youtube algo, and I honestly prefer you just comment here on Reddit) but if you want to watch it:&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://youtu.be/fJC-dXwSIo4\"&gt;I Watched 200 Finance Videos. Buy These 14 Stocks!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Trump says his escalating tariffs are meant to pressure Denmark into selling Greenland, but they also risk provoking European trade retaliation and weakening NATO. Over the long run, this could allow Russia and China to exploit a fractured West—or, alternatively, spur Europe’s rearmament and emergence as a third global power. Either scenario could be deeply negative for investors.\n\n\n\nA new world order is hard to imagine, and it’s plausible that investors find it so difficult to price such a possibility that they simply ignore it. Something similar occurred after the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. Markets largely shrugged it off for nearly a month; when war finally seemed inevitable, panic set in, triggering a financial meltdown in London, then the center of global finance.\n\n\n\nLikewise, Russian bond prices rose rather than fell for months after the Communist government repudiated Russia’s debt in 1918, effectively wiping it out. (Investors’ heirs eventually received only minimal compensation.) When World War II began in September 1939, British stocks initially dropped, but by March 1940 they had reached a one-year high, according to data from fund manager Winton Group. Investors failed to anticipate that Nazi forces would overrun continental Europe, devastate British industry through air raids, and ultimately cost the U.K. its empire. Stock prices collapsed only after France fell.\n\n  \n[https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/trump-wants-greenland-markets-dont-know-what-to-make-of-that-a9fc6b9e](https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/trump-wants-greenland-markets-dont-know-what-to-make-of-that-a9fc6b9e)",

Trump says his escalating tariffs are meant to pressure Denmark into selling Greenland, but they also risk provoking European trade retaliation and weakening NATO. Over the long run, this could allow Russia and China to exploit a fractured West—or, alternatively, spur Europe’s rearmament and emergence as a third global power. Either scenario could be deeply negative for investors.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;A new world order is hard to imagine, and it’s plausible that investors find it so difficult to price such a possibility that they simply ignore it. Something similar occurred after the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914. Markets largely shrugged it off for nearly a month; when war finally seemed inevitable, panic set in, triggering a financial meltdown in London, then the center of global finance.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Likewise, Russian bond prices rose rather than fell for months after the Communist government repudiated Russia’s debt in 1918, effectively wiping it out. (Investors’ heirs eventually received only minimal compensation.) When World War II began in September 1939, British stocks initially dropped, but by March 1940 they had reached a one-year high, according to data from fund manager Winton Group. Investors failed to anticipate that Nazi forces would overrun continental Europe, devastate British industry through air raids, and ultimately cost the U.K. its empire. Stock prices collapsed only after France fell.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/trump-wants-greenland-markets-dont-know-what-to-make-of-that-a9fc6b9e\"&gt;https://www.wsj.com/finance/investing/trump-wants-greenland-markets-dont-know-what-to-make-of-that-a9fc6b9e&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

Why the Stock Market Doesn’t Care.\n\nBy  Teresa Rivas\n\nFollow\n\nJan 14, 2026 4:48 pm EST\n\nhttps://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-rally-iran-venezuela-fed-b5bfac0b\n\nKey Points\n\n\\- The S&amp;P 500 reached new records three times in the first seven trading days of 2026, with a 1.2% return year-to-date.\n\n\\- Despite geopolitical risks and tumultuous news, the stock market has remained calm, with investors not pricing in these uncertainties.\n\n\\- Strong economic indicators support the market’s current performance.\n\nIt might be an understatement to say 2026 has gotten off to a chaotic start. You would never know it by looking at the stock market.\n\nThe S&amp;P 500 closed at new records three times in the first seven trading days of 2026, and isn’t far from its all-time high of 6977, with a 1.2% return for the year so far. Those gains belie a tumultuous news cycle and rising geopolitical risks.\n\n“Don’t be alarmed that the stock market is about to fall off a cliff amid a fog of dizzying headlines,” writes Christopher Smart, managing partner of the investment strategy consultancy Arbroath Group. “But don’t assume that a rising S&amp;P 500 index means that everything is fine.”\n\nStocks have shrugged off…practically everything in the first two weeks of the year. The U.S. capture of Venezuela’s president, President Donald Trump’s threats to invade Greenland, the growing risk of a U.S. military attack on Iran, and the increasingly urgent question of the Federal Reserve’s independence are all major headlines that happened before we even hit January’s midway point.\n\nThere are very real reasons to worry about each of those risks, along with other federal policy upheavals and their cumulative effects over time. Yet the stock market has historically had a hard time quantifying the consequences of these types of risk, which helps explain the rather blasé reaction to unprecedented events.\n\n“Investors just don’t know how to price in geopolitical risks on any given day, so they don’t,” writes Smart. “But sooner or later the risk premium catches up with everyone.”\n\n===== snip ======",
