But this isn't the first person to mention that US treasuries are getting less appealing with each passing day. \n\nNow if Canada Japan, China and the UK start moving away from us bonds it could have seismic effects on America's ability to borrow at a discount as it has for so long.\nAnd I think it's likely you'll see something like this from EU countries in general and hopefully the Commonwealth as well (although the UK has been a bit fickle in backing Canada up, so I'm not holding my breath that they're going to grow a pair anytime soon). Japan is in a bind. China though could do it for the lulz.",
