**General Characteristics of Viral Content (format and platform agnostic)**

**Value Drivers:**

*   **Practical** – Saves time, money, or effort. 
    
    *   Useful content is shareable because it makes the sender feel helpful.
        
*   **Personal** – Reflects who they are or aspire to be.
    
    *   Deliver utility in ways that align with how your audience sees themselves. 
        
    *   Meet people at emotional moments (content hits harder when it aligns with what people are already feeling or navigating).
        
*   **Social** – Enhances status or influence. 
    
    *   People share content that makes them look smart, informed, or ahead of the curve—especially if it feels exclusive, novel, or surprising.
        
*   Note: While multiple value types can strengthen content, many viral posts succeed powerfully with just one dominant value type.
    

**Emotions:**

*   **Leverage high-arousal emotions** (e.g., anger, awe, surprise, humor, fear).
    
*   About 80% of social posts reflect people's immediate reality, so content **meeting people at emotional moments** (identity shifts, life transitions, current frustrations) has natural entry points. 
    
*   High-engagement content often focuses on the **most emotionally provocative aspect of a topic rather than the "main" story**—for example, a protester mistaking a Greek flag for an Israeli flag became the #1 content about the Middle East conflict because of its sensationalist appeal.
    

**Small Account Advantages:**

*   Small accounts (500-5k followers) often achieve the highest engagement multipliers by expressing what larger accounts are **too risk-averse to say**. 
    
*   Audiences often find smaller accounts more credible and **authentic** than mega-influencers or corporate accounts. Leaning into authenticity can lower the bar for “quality” and build trust (vs. highly polished content). 
    

**Design for Sharing and Entertainment:**

*   Make your point up front—**headlines and summaries often are the content**. 59% of links shared on Twitter have never been clicked.
    
*   Keep it **simple** and repeatable—make ideas easy to grasp and retell.
    
*   Wrap ideas in story – **Narratives bypass skepticism and stick in memory**.
    
*   **Make it entertaining** – People get on social media to be entertained. Even serious topics don’t have to always have serious angles – humor, sarcasm, and other ways to package content can amplify shareability.
