**Format:** Quick Hits
**Visual Style:** Miniature Model / Diorama

## **1. Script (Read time: ~50-60s)**

**(Visual: Scene 1 - The Broken Scales)**
**Narrator:** The market just broke its own rules. Usually, when stocks drop, gold goes up as a safety net—but yesterday, everything crashed at once.

**(Visual: Scene 2 - The Panic Button)**
**Narrator:** The tech selloff is widening fast. Nvidia slipped, but the real pain is hitting the fringes—Pinterest dropped 20% after hours, now trading at a P/E of just 5. The market is currently in a "shoot first, ask questions later" mood for anything AI might disrupt.

**(Visual: Scene 3 - The Empty Safe)**
**Narrator:** But here’s the weird part—the "safety trade" collapsed too. Gold dropped back below $5,000, and Silver plunged over 11% in a single day. If you were hiding in precious metals yesterday, you actually lost *more* than the tech investors.

**(Visual: Scene 4 - The Bulldozer)**
**Narrator:** So where is the smart money actually going? Boring, old-school value. While tech and metals bleed, dividend aristocrats like Caterpillar are quietly up 10% this year. The rotation isn't to safety; it's to tangible stuff you can actually kick.

**(Visual: Scene 5 - The Playbook)**
**Narrator:** The takeaway? The old playbook isn't working right now—keep your eye on the boring stuff.

## **2. Visual Prompts**

### **Guidelines Applied:**
*   **Style:** Small-scale handcrafted physical miniature sets (Diorama/Tilt-shift aesthetic).
*   **Text:** Minimized on-screen text to avoid AI rendering errors (relying on props/symbols).
*   **Motion:** Subtle camera moves (push-in, pan) for AI video stability.
*   **Consistency:** "Handcrafted," "clay," "miniature," and "studio lighting" tags used throughout.

### **Scene 1: The Broken Scales** (Intro Hook)
*   **Image Prompt:** A small-scale handcrafted physical miniature set of an old brass balance scale sitting on a wooden desk. On the left pan, a pile of tiny computer chips made of clay. On the right pan, tiny glittering gold bars. The scale is tipping dramatically, with the heavy side actually smashing through the wooden surface. Soft studio lighting, visible miniature textures, macro photography style.
*   **Video Prompt:** Push-in shot on the balance scale. As the camera moves closer, the scale tips violently and the heavy side crashes down, breaking the miniature table. Maintain the miniature diorama aesthetic.

### **Scene 2: The Panic Button** (Tech Selloff)
*   **Image Prompt:** A diorama of a modern office floor with tiny plastic figures in business suits running in panic. In the center of the room, a massive, oversized bright red panic button has crashed through the ceiling, crushing a desk. Debris scattered around. High-contrast dramatic lighting, miniature model photography style.
*   **Video Prompt:** Pan across the office scene, following the tiny figures running away from the giant red button. The camera shakes slightly to emphasize the impact.

### **Scene 3: The Empty Safe** (Gold/Silver Crash)
*   **Image Prompt:** A close-up of a miniature bank vault door, crafted from metal and clay, swinging open. Inside, instead of gold, there is a large, jagged hole in the floor leading to darkness. A single tiny figure stands at the edge, looking down. Moody lighting, depth of field focused on the figure, miniature diorama style.
*   **Video Prompt:** The vault door slowly creaks open. The camera pushes past the door to reveal the empty hole in the floor.

### **Scene 4: The Bulldozer** (Boring Rotation)
*   **Image Prompt:** A miniature construction site scene. A bright yellow bulldozer, detailed model, is pushing a pile of broken circuit boards and wires over the edge of a 'cliff' (the edge of the table). The ground behind the bulldozer is smooth and solid. Bright, sunny lighting, miniature photography.
*   **Video Prompt:** The bulldozer drives forward, its blade pushing the pile of tech debris off the edge. Dust rises from the tracks.

### **Scene 5: The Playbook** (Closer)
*   **Image Prompt:** A top-down shot of a miniature desk. A stack of tiny papers covered in miniature financial charts and graphs. A real human hand enters the frame, placing a tiny yellow construction hard hat on top of the papers. The contrast between the real hand and the miniature objects emphasizes the scale. Soft, warm lighting.
*   **Video Prompt:** The hand comes down and gently places the hard hat on the papers. The camera pulls back slightly to show the whole desk setup.
