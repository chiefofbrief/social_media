## Stock & Markets Analysis

### 1. Market & Macro Overview

Thursday delivered a broad, sentiment-driven selloff with the Dow falling 600+ points, the S&P 500 losing 1.54%, and the Nasdaq retreating 2% (WSJ #1). Bear ETFs surged across the board—SOXS +7.42%, SQQQ +6.13%, TZA +6.18% (Most Actives)—while tech-heavy leveraged products cratered: TQQQ -6.11%, SOXL -7.27%.

**Indicators:**
- **Gold/Silver**: Gold slipped back below $5,000/oz after a 2.9% session decline (WSJ #13, #15). Silver was hammered harder—SLV -11.53%, with the inverse ZSL surging +23.9% (Most Actives). Gold miners were crushed: GDXU -22.28%, AGQ -22.31% (Losers). This is a notable reversal for precious metals after a sustained run—worth watching whether this is profit-taking or a genuine shift in safe-haven flows.
- **Treasury Yields**: Fell on weak U.S. housing data despite resilient employment numbers (WSJ #11). The Fed sees "little reason" to cut rates given stubborn inflation and strong jobs (Barron's #16). CPI data is pending for Friday morning (Barron's #4, #5)—expected softer, but unlikely to shift the Fed's stance.
- **Oil**: Turned lower despite unresolved U.S.-Iran tensions, weighed by a large U.S. crude stock build (WSJ #16). Venezuela's oil sector is reopening to U.S. engagement (Intrigue - Venezuela), while Russia faces mounting sanctions pressure with record price discounts on unsold floating barrels (WSJ #20). The supply picture is complex and shifting.
- **Dollar**: Weakened despite labor market resilience keeping the Fed on hold—Corpay calls this "entrenched bearishness" (WSJ #19). A weak dollar alongside risk-off equity positioning is an unusual combination that bears monitoring.

**Sentiment:** Fear-driven and broadening. The session began positive but reversed sharply—the second consecutive failed rally attempt (Barron's #1). What began as an AI/SaaS-specific correction is now expanding into financials, freight brokers, insurance, and other asset-light models (Barron's #19, #21, #33). Reddit reflects genuine confusion—if the selloff is AI-driven, why are AI stocks also falling? (r/ValueInvesting #4). This "shoot first, ask questions later" dynamic (WSJ #3) is characteristic of sentiment-driven repricing rather than fundamental reassessment. Per Part III of the Guidelines: when the market is repricing broadly on fear, the analytical opportunity lies in separating temporary sentiment damage from permanent impairment.

### 2. AI Ecosystem Positioning

The dominant theme is **AI disruption fears spreading beyond tech into new sectors**, creating a widening selloff that is now hitting businesses perceived as AI-vulnerable regardless of their actual AI exposure.

**Applications & Software (Layer 8):**
- The SaaS bloodbath is intensifying and dominating sentiment. Pinterest dropped 20% after-hours on weak earnings amid a restructuring (Barron's #37, #38). Reddit users are debating whether these are value opportunities or traps (r/ValueInvesting #1, #11, #15—PINS at P/E ~5). The MSFT insight post captures the zeitgeist: "Claude for Excel is basically saying, no one needs a siloed SaaS platform" (r/ValueInvesting #6).
- Per the AI framework's "Software Disruption vs. Moat Durability" lens: the market is aggressively pricing in the disruption narrative. The counter-arguments (switching costs, network effects, deep enterprise integrations) are being ignored in the current fear cycle. This is where narrative vs. reality divergence may be widest.
- Freelance platforms Fiverr and Upwork are in distress (r/stocks #8)—asset-light, labor-intermediation businesses that are direct targets of AI agent capabilities.

**Compute & Chips (Layers 1-2):**
- Cisco fell 12.32% on higher memory costs pressuring margins (Barron's #44)—this connects directly to the "Memory Constraints" thesis in the AI framework. NVDA was down 1.64% and heavily traded, while INTC fell 3.75% (Most Actives).
- South Korea chipmaker fund received record inflows (r/stocks #6), suggesting institutional capital is rotating toward foundry/memory plays even as broader tech sells off—consistent with a "picks-and-shovels" thesis.
- MU (Micron) attracting swing-trade interest at current levels (r/stocks #11, r/options #13).

**Infrastructure & Power (Layer 3):**
- Big Tech accounting is creating a "blind spot" as depreciation expenses are about to soar (WSJ #6). This is a critical signal—per the AI framework's "Depreciation Risk," new chip cycles (Blackwell B100) rapidly devalue older hardware. The depreciation surge will hit reported earnings for hyperscalers even as CapEx continues rising. This is the kind of GAAP vs. Economic Reality tension the Guidelines emphasize.

**Models & Tools (Layers 4-7):**
- Anthropic now valued at $380B, with AI leaders threatening to crowd out IPO candidates (Barron's #25). The sovereign AI movement is accelerating globally—LatAm-GPT launch, Mistral expanding, multiple Asian sovereign models (Intrigue). This validates the ecosystem's growing strategic importance but also introduces long-term competitive fragmentation risk for incumbent model providers.

**Cross-Cutting AI Theme - The "HALO" Trade:**
- Barron's introduces "HALO" stocks—companies with perceived AI immunity (Barron's #29). A dividend aristocrat ETF is already up 10% in 2026 led by Caterpillar (Barron's #35). The rotation from tech into value/cyclicals is real (Barron's #24), with the equal-weight S&P holding up better than cap-weighted (Barron's #22). Consumer staples, however, may themselves be a bubble—PE analysis shows many are overvalued relative to growth (r/ValueInvesting #3).

---

### 3. Applied Investment Flags

**Narrative vs. Reality:**

- **"AI is killing everything" narrative**: The market is treating AI disruption as a binary event—either a company has AI immunity or it doesn't. But the selloff is hitting AI infrastructure companies alongside AI victims, which contradicts the narrative. If AI is truly disrupting software, the enablers (NVDA, hyperscalers) should benefit. Instead, everything is falling, suggesting this is a broader risk-off/de-leveraging event dressed up in an AI narrative (r/ValueInvesting #4, WSJ #3). Per the Guidelines: "Market narratives often rationalize price movements after the fact."

- **BDC/AI exposure overstated?** An analyst argues the market is overreacting to BDC AI exposure (Barron's #13). This is worth investigating—if disruption concerns are affecting credit markets and refinancing ability for software companies, that creates a reflexive feedback loop (per the Guidelines' reflexivity framework): fear of AI disruption → tighter credit → actual business deterioration → validating the fear.

- **Financial sector AI fears**: Schwab, LPL, Ameriprise selling off on AI fears, with Barron's arguing this creates buying opportunities (Barron's #19). Insurance brokers are similarly being lumped in (Barron's #33). These are high switching-cost businesses with regulatory moats—the AI disruption timeline for financial advice and insurance brokerage is likely measured in years, not quarters.

**Edge Opportunities:**

- **Depreciation blind spot** (WSJ #6): If Big Tech's depreciation expenses are about to surge, this will mechanically compress reported P/E ratios. Investors focused on GAAP earnings may sell, while those focused on cash generation (per Guidelines Part I: "GAAP profits ≠ bona fide profits") may find the dislocation creates opportunity—or reveals that returns on invested capital are lower than the market assumed.

- **Precious metals reversal**: Gold and silver's sharp decline (-2.9% and -11.5% respectively) amid a risk-off equity session is counter-intuitive. Normally safe-haven assets rally when equities sell off. This suggests forced selling, margin calls, or a genuine shift in the rate outlook. The pending CPI data (Barron's #4) could resolve this—hotter inflation would support gold, cooler inflation validates the Fed pause and dollar weakness.

### 4. Screening Candidates

#### Candidate 1: CSCO (Cisco Systems)
- **The Signal:** Barron's #44, Most Actives (CSCO -12.32%)
- **What News Says:** Cisco was the worst Dow performer on Thursday, tumbling on higher memory costs pressuring margins. The stock is feeling pressure from rising component costs associated with AI-driven infrastructure buildout.
- **The Why:** Memory cost pressure connects directly to the AI ecosystem's "Memory Constraints" thesis. If CSCO's margin compression is driven by HBM/DRAM pricing power at the supplier level, it validates the infrastructure bottleneck thesis—but also flags a potential buying opportunity if the cost pressure is temporary and AI networking demand is structural.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Check gross margin trends over last 4-6 quarters; compare component cost pass-through ability
  - Verify whether memory cost pressure is across all product lines or concentrated in AI/data center networking
  - Web search: CSCO earnings call details, management commentary on margin trajectory
- **Data Gap:** Need to determine if CSCO can pass through higher memory costs to customers or if competitive dynamics prevent repricing.

#### Candidate 2: PINS (Pinterest)
- **The Signal:** Barron's #37, #38, r/ValueInvesting #15
- **What News Says:** Pinterest stock dropped 20% after-hours following weak earnings amid a restructuring. Reddit users note P/E is now around 5 with double-digit growth.
- **The Why:** A P/E of ~5 with double-digit revenue growth on a platform with 500M+ MAU and visual search/commerce capabilities is an extreme valuation. Either the market is pricing in severe, permanent AI disruption to its ad business, or this is a panic-driven mispricing. Per the Guidelines on opportunity sources: "Best opportunities combine high-quality businesses with large but solvable one-time problems."
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Verify the P/E claim; check advertising revenue trends, user engagement metrics, and operating leverage
  - Assess restructuring charges vs. ongoing cost structure—is the restructuring a sign of real trouble or strategic repositioning?
  - Evaluate Pinterest's AI moat: visual search and shopping intent data may actually be *enhanced* by AI rather than disrupted by it
- **Data Gap:** Need actual Q4 earnings details—revenue growth rate, user growth, ARPU trends, and management's restructuring rationale.

#### Candidate 3: RIVN (Rivian)
- **The Signal:** Barron's #15
- **What News Says:** Rivian beat Q4 estimates with $120M gross profit on $1.3B sales (Wall Street expected breakeven gross profit on $1.2B). The company forecasts growth in 2026.
- **The Why:** Positive gross profit inflection for an EV maker is a significant milestone—it signals the business model is becoming self-sustaining. With Trump revoking EPA greenhouse gas rules (Barron's #46), the EV landscape is shifting: reduced regulatory tailwinds, but Rivian's truck/SUV positioning may benefit from reduced competition as compliance-driven EV programs at legacy OEMs lose urgency.
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Assess path to operating profitability—how much SGA and R&D sits between gross profit and net income?
  - Verify whether gross profit is sustainable or driven by one-time items (credits, mix shift)
  - EPA rule change impact: Does reduced regulatory pressure help (less competition) or hurt (lower ZEV credit value)?
- **Data Gap:** Need to understand Rivian's cash runway and whether 2026 growth targets require additional capital raises at potentially dilutive levels.

#### Candidate 4: NFLX (Netflix) — Investigating the Disconnect
- **The Signal:** r/ValueInvesting #5, r/stocks #2, Most Actives (NFLX -4.72% at $75.86)
- **What News Says:** Netflix is down 25%+ over the past year and fell another 4.72% Thursday. Reddit users are confused—NFLX is the undisputed streaming leader but continues declining. References to a "WB deal" weighing on the stock, with the decline predating current AI fears.
- **The Why:** The disconnect between dominant market position and persistent stock decline warrants investigation. At $75.86, a former $700+ stock is either a deep value opportunity or the market is pricing in structural threats (content cost inflation, subscriber saturation, competition from AI-generated content). Per the Guidelines: "Distinguish temporary problems (depress prices) from permanent impairments."
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Financial statements: Recent revenue, subscriber growth, and margin trends
  - What is the "WB deal" referenced—an acquisition? Licensing change? How material is it?
  - Assess whether AI content generation represents a genuine existential threat or a narrative
- **Data Gap:** Need current P/E, FCF yield, and subscriber metrics to determine if the price decline has created a genuine margin of safety.

#### Theme: The "Rotation Trade" — Value/Cyclicals vs. Deflating Tech
- **The Signal:** Barron's #2, #24, #35, r/ValueInvesting #3, #10
- **What News Says:** Investors are rotating from tech into value/cyclical stocks. A dividend aristocrat ETF is up 10% YTD led by Caterpillar. EM funds received 2x January inflows vs. all of 2025 (Barron's #23). South Korea chipmaker ETFs seeing record flows (r/stocks #6).
- **The Why:** If this rotation has legs, the opportunity set shifts from "buy the dip in tech" to "identify which value/cyclical names benefit from the capital reallocation." However, the counter-argument is that consumer staples are themselves overvalued (r/ValueInvesting #3 argues the bubble may be in staples, not tech). The NVDA-WMT comparison (same P/E, wildly different PEG) captures the dilemma perfectly (r/ValueInvesting #8).
- **Investigation Items:**
  - Screen value/cyclical names benefiting from rotation (CAT, industrial names, EM exposure)
  - Validate whether consumer staples valuations are stretched relative to growth
  - Monitor whether rotation is institutional or retail-driven (character of the flow matters for sustainability)
- **Data Gap:** Need P/E-to-growth comparisons across sectors to identify where value actually exists vs. where money is piling into "safety" without regard to valuation.

# 🌍 Why countries want their own AI

Plus: They let kids vote in...

Feb 12, 2026

**Today’s briefing:**  
— Why countries want their own AI  
— Guess who’s in Venezuela  
— Another assassination attempt in…

**Good morning {{first_name | Intriguer}}**. Latin America is really having a “ _moment_ ” this week. Fresh off the high of Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime spectacular, the region also just got its very own **LatAm-GPT**. Founded by Chile and supported by other regional countries, it’s the first open-source artificial intelligence language model that’s specifically trained on Latin American data.

You might be wondering why we at Intrigue are writing about this for our top story today. It’s because we’ve believed since our inception that tech and geopolitics are increasingly inseparable — especially when it comes to AI. And as AI juggernauts US and China pull ahead with their frontier models, the rest of the world risks falling behind.

### Number of the day

**10 million**

That’s Switzerland’s proposed new population cap, subject to a national referendum in June. If passed (it’s polling ~50/50), the government could move to limit immigration and review Switzerland’s Schengen agreements (free movement for EU citizens). The country’s population is currently around nine million. 

### **The world of AI**

While you might know beautiful Chile for its copper, its wines, its pisco-fight with Peru, or its ridiculously long and skinny profile like it’s spooning Argentina (_nena,_ wake up), there’s now a new reason: Chile just launched Latin America’s own large language model. 

Creatively named**LatAm-GPT** , the idea is to _“develop capabilities in the region to_ _**have independence**_ _and make decisions about how this technology impacts society.”_

It took the _mateos_ (slang for nerds) over at the National Center of Artificial Intelligence of Chile two years and two dozen partnerships to develop, but you only need its opening sentence above to see the bigger debate on AI independence.****

The buzzword in AI circles is ‘**sovereign AI** ’, and it’s rapidly evolving from a niche idea to a strategic must, as the world grapples with what’s really at stake with generative AI (beyond market share):

  * **First** , there’s the **loss of jobs** (though a new [study](<https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it>) argues AI could be _intensifying_ work, not replacing it)

  * **Second** , there’s the **loss of human agency and connection**(though again [a recent study](<https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/AI%20Companions%20Reduce%20Loneliness%2011.7.2025_57451c02-8047-4e0d-abfc-55841f64166d.pdf>) argues AI helps more than it harms)

  * **Third** , there’s the **loss of democratic control** (though Taiwan has shown how AI could help de-polarise societies), and

  * **Fourth** , there’s the **loss of technological control** over super-intelligent systems (though there’s rare US-China agreement on humans controlling nukes, for example).




So with a growing governmental fear of getting stuck in a dependence loop as China and US-based hyperscalers duke it out for dominance, plus a growing _user_ fear of foreign-trained AI erasing folks’ socio-linguistic roots, responses like LatAm-GPT feel inevitable.

And in fact, we’re already seeing them around the world, starting in…

  1. **The Middle East**




When you have Scrooge McDuck piles of cash you can go early — the Emiratis launched _Falcon_ way back in 2023, and their Saudi rivals launched _ALLaM_ the following year.

  * The multilingual Emirati model performs well against global benchmarks, whereas

  * The Arabic-first Saudi model prioritises regional dialects and cultural nuances.




But they’re both regional sovereignty plays emphasizing Arabic excellence, curbing their foreign dependencies, and all still built on open-source foundations.

Then at the other end of the ‘go early’ spectrum, there’s (ahem)…

  2. **Europe**




It’s easy to blame the EU’s slower AI approach on its famed AI Act, a kind of ‘**sovereignty by standards** ’ play that emphasises consumer and citizen protections. But while that law might’ve tapped the brakes, Europe’s gentler AI pace predates its regulation for various reasons — think limits around (say) compute, capital concentration, and energy.

Anyway, Europe’s frontrunner is **France’s Mistral** , founded back in 2023 by ex-DeepMind and Meta researchers. Seen as Europe’s OpenAI, its efficient, open-weight offerings have become popular among European firms wanting to de-risk abroad.

And just yesterday, Mistral announced its first major infrastructure outside France with a new data centre in **Sweden** , popular for its cheap renewable energy and cooler climes. 

Then at the other end of the ‘cooler climes’ spectrum, let’s finish in…

  3. **Asia**




Singapore’s government-backed **SEA-LION** model is on-brand for the region’s long-time hub — it’s both multilingual (Bahasa, Thai, Vietnamese, Tamil, Khmer, Lao, et al) and multimodal (text + image, with video and audio en route).

By promising more accurate, localised responses, it’s giving neighbours a way to avoid going full-US or full-China, enticing them full-Singapore instead. Again, very on-brand.

But while Japan’s **Rakuten** is wowing locals with its cultural-linguistic depth, and India’s **Sarvam** is really flexing its _breadth_ (20,000 dialects!), the region’s top-performer on sheer metrics might be South Korea’s **Naver** , now enjoying viral adoption, government-backed scale, and legit real world performance.

And with that, maybe go touch some grass while we reflect on what this all means. 

Intrigue’s Take

So many big questions flow from all this, but here are two. **First** , **should every country now develop its own AI?** Maybe that depends on how you want to define success, but the presence of so many early, state-backed LLMs suggests many capitals would rather not wait for the answer, or already _know_ the answer: ie, perhaps success here is simply any competent model not dominated by China or the US.

And that leads us to the **second** question, whose best answer might’ve just been articulated by one of AI’s chief architects, Dario Amodei (CEO of Anthropic): _**why**_**are so many capitals already charging ahead?** Amodei’s [latest essay](<https://www.darioamodei.com/essay/the-adolescence-of-technology>) poses a gloomy thought experiment now doing the rounds: imagine a new country appears overnight, populated by 50 million people each way smarter than any Nobel laureate, capable of making ten moves for every one step we take. How should we respond? 

Amodei answers his own question like this: “ _a report from a competent national security official to a head of state would probably contain words like ‘_ _**the single most serious national security threat**_ _we’ve faced in a century, possibly ever.’_ ”

Now sure, maybe that’s just classic capitalism — there’s a fun [parody](<https://x.com/Delicious_Tacos/status/2021659515918397630>) likening Amodei to a hot-dog CEO warning your only survival option is… buy more hot-dogs. 

But enough capitals are seeing something over the horizon or inside the wire, it reminds us of that _Oppenheimer_ line as the world realises the power of nuclear weapons: “ _I don't know if we can be trusted with such a weapon. But I know they can't._ ”

### Meanwhile, elsewhere…

🇲🇾******MALAYSIA** -**Who’s watching the watchdog?**  
A damning Bloomberg investigation suggests Malaysia’s anti-corruption agency has been helping a local “ _corporate mafia_ ” oust founders and seize companies. (_[Bloomberg](<https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-02-11/malaysia-macc-allegedly-working-with-businessmen-to-seize-control-of-companies>)_ _$)_

**_Comment:_**_The agency chief denies the allegations and is threatening Bloomberg with legal letters, but the outlet has now hit his organisation three days in a row, publicly thwarting Prime Minister Anwar’s efforts to attract foreign investment. The easy way out for Anwar is to just let the graft-buster’s contract expire in May._

🇻🇪******VENEZUELA** -**Welcome back.**  
US energy secretary Chris Wright has had an upbeat meeting with interim leader Rodriguez, a day after the US authorised more US tech, goods, and services for use in Venezuela’s oil & gas sector. It might be the most senior US visit to Venezuela in decades, with Wright urging Caracas to do more to facilitate investment. ([_Al Jazeera_](<https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/12/us-energy-secretary-chris-wright-touts-oil-production-on-venezuela-visit>) _)_

**_Comment:_**_There are still mixed views on where to next: the main US energy stats agency just foreshadowed a possible 20% crude output bump in the coming months, presumably in response to low-hanging fruit like the above new US license. But just hours ago, France’s TotalEnergies joined the list of energy majors warning Venezuela’s energy sector is still basically uninvestable. Meanwhile back in DC, word is “nothing definitive” came from the_ _**Trump-Netanyahu**_ _chat on Iran._

🇺🇦 **UKRAINE** \- **Vote or bust.**   
There are claims President Zelensky plans to announce on February 24 (the war’s four-year anniversary) both a presidential election and referendum on a prospective peace plan. The Financial Times says the White House has pushed Kyiv to hold both votes by May 15 or risk losing proposed US security guarantees. ([FT](<https://www.ft.com/content/50d3d86b-2d2a-4d06-845e-a4e089382cad>) $) 

**Comment** :_Zelensky is denying the FT reports, reiterating Ukraine realistically needs a ceasefire and security guarantees to run any vote. We explored the various difficulties_[here](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/ukraines-elections-red-herring-or-actual-debate/>) _._

🇰🇷 **SOUTH KOREA** \- **You can’t say that!**   
Vietnam has lodged a formal protest after a county-level official from South Korea’s ruling party suggested Seoul should “ _import young women_ ” from Southeast Asia to help tackle the world’s lowest birth rate. ([BBC](<https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20z4254524o>))

🇮🇩 **INDONESIA** \- **Troops for Gaza.**   
Local outlets are again reporting Indonesia’s military is preparing for a potential deployment to Gaza as part of President Trump’s peace plan, though it’s unclear if Jakarta is still envisaging health and reconstruction roles only. President Prabowo just confirmed he’ll attend Trump’s first [Board of Peace](<https://www.internationalintrigue.io/trumps-board-of-peace-wants-to-replace-the-un/>) meeting later this month. ([MEE](<https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/indonesia-prepares-send-troops-gaza>))

🇧🇫******BURKINA FASO** -**You’re banned.******  
Burkina Faso’s transitional parliament has approved a bill banning all political parties, with the junta arguing it’s necessary to curb polarisation. ([AfricaNews](<https://www.africanews.com/2026/02/10/burkina-fasos-parliament-approves-ban-on-political-parties/>))

**Comment** : _It reminds us of that classic Homer moment when he covers his car’s dash warning then declares, “problem solved!” But of course, the real objective here is just for the junta to further consolidate control._

🇨🇴 **COLOMBIA** \- **Assassination attempt.**  
President Petro says he’s averted another assassination attempt, telling his cabinet his helicopter had to divert out to sea because unspecified people were planning to shoot once he approached his Caribbean coast destination. ([France24](<https://www.france24.com/en/americas/20260210-colombian-president-gustavo-petro-says-survived-assassination-attempt-this-week>))

**Comment** : _Colombia has had no shortage of political assassinations over the years, but Petro has had no shortage of hyperbole, either. With Petro termed-out, the bigger picture here is what’s at stake as violence rises ahead of May’s elections._

###  Extra Intrigue

**Today, 12 February, the world marks…**

  *  _International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers_

  *  _International Darwin Day_ (for the birthday and legacy of Charles himself), and

  *  _International Day for the Prevention of Violent Extremism as and when Conducive to Terrorism_ (some vintage UN bureaucrateese right there). 




### Election of the day

Most countries set their voting age at 18, with some youthful exceptions like Argentina, Austria, and Cuba leaning as low as 16, at least for local ballots.

But Portugal just opted to let _children_ vote in last Sunday’s presidential election. 

Well, sort of. Children accompanying their parents in a Lisbon district received their own ✌️official✌️ ballots to vote for their favourite fictional character, featuring candidates such as Super Mario and Elsa. It sounds like a win-win: parents get 0.2 seconds to themselves in the voting booth, while children learn about civic responsibility.

Rumi, from Korea’s hit animated _K-pop Demon Hunters_ , took home the most votes but will be forced to head a coalition government after falling short of an outright majority.
