_Analysis based on ~30 viral short-form videos (TikTok and YouTube Shorts)._

**Viral Patterns**

_Note: These are recurring patterns are based on the sample posts, but other patterns/formats not identified below may be applicable_

*   **Reaction Pattern**: Low barrier to entry while leveraging existing viral momentum and adding genuine social value. The formula is simple: show viral/trending content, add expert commentary or new context, then provide a fresh perspective with social value.
    
    *   Show viral/trending content, add expert commentary or new context, then provide a fresh perspective with social value.
        
    *   Example: A woman talking to camera has a dog suddenly appear, and the creator adds observational humor with "where did the dog come from though" text.
        
*   **Satirical Expertise Pattern**: Absurdist humor combined with familiar formats creates maximum shareability by making viewers feel intellectually superior while being entertained. Take a trending advice topic, apply obviously exaggerated logic, then create a memorable moment that makes viewers feel "in on the joke."
    
    *   Example: The pressure washing math joke achieves this masterfully with 16,100% engagement by taking the familiar "side hustle" advice format and applying absurd calculations about making billions from pressure washing houses.
        
*   **Reveal Pattern**: Build anticipation through promised revelations that enhance the sharer's status when they pass along "insider knowledge." Promise a revelation in the text or title, build anticipation through pacing, then deliver a satisfying, status-enhancing reveal.
    
    *   Example: The Chinese luxury bag expose (2,385% engagement) promises to reveal how luxury brands are actually manufactured in China, while the Final Destination behind-the-scenes video (1,863% engagement) reveals movie illusion techniques that make viewers feel they've gained exclusive knowledge.
        
*   **AI-Generated Scenario Pattern**: Familiar concepts that can be placed in surprising or impossible contexts. Success comes from balancing novelty with familiarity - recognizable elements placed in surprising scenarios. 
    
    *   Example: The gorilla frat party video (11,060% engagement) places a familiar animal in an impossible human social situation, while the Bible characters as influencers concept (6,286% engagement) reimagines historical religious figures in contemporary social media contexts.
